Love These Boots!,8.5 Wide,Black2,5.0,"I love the look and the quality of these boots!
Although I am an almost size 8, they run small on me when I got size 8 (the toes touched closely the front of the booth, bothering my toes), so I returned and re-purchased a size 8 1/2 Wide.
I will also be putting in orthopaedic insoles and I got them in Wide Width.

What sold me the most is the solid quality of the soles, the quality of the fabrics, the waterproof feature, and the cuteness, overall. 💜! They look like they're going to last forever.

I had my eye on these boots from the time I first saw them, at $62/pair before tax. The price kept going up, even up to $75/pair before tax, at some point. Then back down again and fluctuating.
I kept checking and got them the day they went on sale for $40 before tax. The best $40+ ever spent on shoes!"
"Just Received, May Need to Up A 1/2 Size",8 Wide,Black2,4.0,"Just received, ordered an 8W, and normally I have no problems with shoes fitting me - but, I could keep and deal with my big toe hitting the front, but may have to return for an 8.5. Other than that, they seem super comfy, I like how you can slip on, no zipper to fuss with, just laces. The soles seem decent, we shall see when we test them on ice. If I choose to return, I will update this review."
Very comfortable,7,Black5,5.0,"I was nervous about ordering boots from the internet, I am very picky, but these did not disappoint. I wear a 7 and ordered a 7 , they fit great, although I thought the fur went all the way into the boot, it does not. But it is polar fleece and therefore still very warm, and surprisingly comfortable. I love wearing them , definitely gonna purchase again."
very cute,7.5 Wide,Gray-cam,4.0,"This is so cute, the inside feels cozy. I bought the 7 wide. Unfortunately, it is just a tad too tight with (regular thickness) socks on. I missed the window to return it and exchange for a different size. I'm going to try to stretch it out with a shoe horn. If you have very wide feet like me, I'd suggest getting a half size up. I haven't worn it outside since we haven't had snow like that yet, so I can't speak about the water resistance level. If I can't get it to stretch, I'll have to donate it."
WARM!,8.5 Wide,Black-cam,5.0,"I got these in a size too large for myself, so i gave them to my daughter and got myself the right size. Wide width feet are safe in your regular size! My ankles do get tired if driving a long time while wearing them, but I have large calves and no slope to my Achilles, so it's nothing new. Love these and so does she!"
"Good value, good looks",8 Wide,Black2,4.0,"The boots are a good height and a bit rustic looking but they ARE for bad weather. The faux fur seems thick enough and the soles have good texture and will probably provide the kind of traction I need to prevent falls. (I’m a senior). Also they come in shoe widths to allow for bunions.

Not used for snow yet but if I see problems, will update."
Loving these boots!,10.5,Black3,5.0,"There is enough room for my orthotic inserts and the furry insert on top of them. I wasn’t sure about the laces not going up to the top but I think that is what makes these so comfortable. I’ve had good traction in the snow, even where it is covering ice. I’m wearing them with footies until I can find acceptable boot socks and my feet stay warm."
Really good boots!,7,Black5,5.0,"These fit well, look nice and they keep my feet warm! I used them the other day standing in 6 inches of snow and about 15 degrees all day. My feet stayed warm and dry! They also arrived super fast!!"
Very Comfy,7.5 Wide,Black1,5.0,I bought this shoes for my mom cause it’s snowing in Vermont an she mention it’s the best snow shoes ! Very comfortable and never slippery ! Highly recommend if your going on a day to day job in snow.
Fully lined,6.5,Black2,5.0,"They've held up to the rain, mud and snow so far. I work in a detail shop so the floor is always covered in water and my feet stay dry and warm unless the water comes over the top of the boots."
Adorable!,8,White3,5.0,"I’ve ordered 2 pair from Nordstroms, 2 from Zappos and 1 from Lands End. None of them fit as well or looked as cute as this pair! I have feet that run a bit narrower than a medium width. With socks on, these are perfect. I ordered my normal length. Can’t wait for it to snow!"
Absolutely love these,9 Wide,Gray-cam,5.0,Other than the fact that they did not actually tape the shoebox closed I’m glad the boots made it without the box being opened because it was not taped closed at all but the boots are absolutely amazing. Super soft fit very well.
Super warm!,8.5,Black2,5.0,"I love these boots, the interior is so soft and warm, I can have my feet buried in the snow and not fell cold at all. I am an 8 American but got them in a 8½ to use thicker socks and they feel perfect. 100% recommend"
"Super cute, keep feet dry, but wear extra socks!",7.5,Black2,4.0,"True to size and super cute yet do the job when hiking or in the snow! But they don’t have any arch support and the back of the upper heal can rub, even with socks on so I throw in some insoles and wear extra thick socks and an extra pair underneath and they’re great! Super affordable and again really cute 😍"
Great boots,7.5 Wide,Gray-cam,5.0,I bought them a half size too big so I can wear heavy socks. They are warm and comfortable.
Boots 🥾,8.5 Wide,Black2,5.0,"Very warm, exactly what I wanted. I should have bought a half size bigger just for socks. I can’t wear thick socks with them"
Love my new boots!!,10,Black2,5.0,"No snow yet in WI, but I am ready for winter! Boots arrived today and wore them around the house all afternoon very comfortable. I wear size 9.5 or 10 I ordered a 10, plenty of toe room, no pinching. Stylish looking too. My previous boots were zip up and it was a challenge to get pants tucked in and zipped. I wasn't sure I would like the tie up style, but they were great today tying up over the top of pants no issues at all!"
Just a bit bulkier than I expected,8,White5,4.0,"Pros: Overall seems solid, very nice soft warm material inside, you basically eant to keep touching it:). Looks great.

Cons:
- There is some excessive material inside over my toes, doesn’t seems to bother me much, but noticeable (feel wise).
- They look just a bit bigger and shorter than on pictures, more like ski boots, I hoped for a bit smaller.
- Tongue have openings 2.5-3 in from top, which from description was unexpected."
Keeps feet dry,8.5 Wide,Gray-cam,5.0,Very happy with my purchase. They fit perfectly and best part they keep your feet nice and dry. Great snow boots.
Size is perfect.,9.5,Black2,5.0,These boots fit well and look good. Can’t wait to try them in the snow.
Stylish,9.5,Black2,5.0,Warm on the inside and true to size.
So so,8,Gray-cam,4.0,While these boots fit perfectly and keep my feet warm. I am currently without a car so I am doing a lot of walking. There isn’t much cushion and none on the ball of my foot so I will be looking for a different pair
Good value,7.5,White2,5.0,Well made good price
Fits true to size. Warm. The grip is no slip.,8.5,White2,4.0,Priced nicely. Warm. Cleans up nice.
"Soft, comfy and affordable",7.5 Wide,Black1,5.0,I struggle finding boots I like for a decent price and I have to say I am very satisfied. They are beyond expectations. 7 1/2 wide are a little big but I am a 7 so it makes sense. The sole is extremely durable looking and traction is awesome. Style is still cute enough for a nice jacket. Not clunky at all. Light weight.
Great boots,9 Wide,White-1,5.0,I love my boots. Warm and cozy. Arrived on time. Very pleased 😀 Thank you
Slightly tight fit.,8 Wide,Black1,4.0,"Just received them. My size is 8W, these feels like they’d be more comfortable if I’d gone up half a size. Will update on how they hold up in cold and snowy weather later."
Taking them to a winter in Iceland,8 Wide,Brown,4.0,They seem perfect and comfortable. The real test is when we arrive for a November in Iceland. Will update if they suck
Perfect fit!,9 Wide,Black3,5.0,These are well-made with a lovely chunky sole sand BERY comfy cozy.
,6.5,Black2,5.0,Just liked
boots,8 Wide,Black3,5.0,Love them warm and comfortable
Very comfy,9 Wide,Black6,5.0,This boot look so good and feels great !
Keep buying from your company,8.5,Black1,5.0,Very warm
True to size,6,Black1,5.0,I purchased these for my daughter in law. They are super nice and very warm.
Warmth and waterproof,7.5,White2,5.0,I live in the snow and it's important to keep my feet warm in the winter I have not yet got to try them in the cold but I have tried them on they're very comfortable and appear to be waterproof I won't be able to let you know until I get snow but so far they look amazing they're beautiful they're very comfortable
"It arrived so fast, I was surprised",9.5,White2,4.0,"I love them!! They fit perfectly and it looks and feels like it will keep my feet warm, I'll let you know in another review about that (not quite winter yet)😜"
3.5 stars by a Minnesotan,9,Black1,4.0,"Since there are no half stars, I'll give this a 4 star rating. I'll start with the things I don't like and move to what I do like. Also, I would like to mention that I don't like reviewing items like this until I've had proper time to really form an opinion and see what normal use will do to it, but since we're in the heart of winter now, I feel I should review sooner than I care to for those that it might help in making buying decisions.

What I don't like:
They're not as attractive in real life as in the photos, but honestly, that's a minor complaint. I bought a half size larger than I usually wear thinking I'd need to do that so that thick wool socks would work, but it turns out I didn't need to do this and they're a little too big with most of my socks (but not my *very* thick socks, so I guess that's acceptable). They're not very comfortable. My right foot in particular tends to hurt after walking in these for long.

What I do like:
These are waterproof. Some reviews have said they're not, but they are. I've walked through varying amounts of snow, from a dusting to nearly knee deep, and except where snow managed to get in through the top, which you can't really stop from happening if it's deep enough, there's been no problem there, and also through slush and water puddles from melted snow, and these boots keep my feet warm and dry.

I have not slipped on ice at all. I have crunched over lumps and shards of ice and had no problems. These boots seem to have good traction.

I haven't had these long enough to comment on their durability, but so far they seem to be holding up fine. I don't use these for really extended periods of time and usually just to walk about a mile 5 days a week or so, so if they aren't going to hold up over a longer amount of time, I don't know yet.

Though they leave something to be desired for comfort, they're good snow boots and as a Minnesotan that deals with harsh winter conditions, I still highly recommend these boots."
Very warm and beautiful,8,Brown,5.0,Great for snow and ice
Great boots,9.5,Black5,5.0,"I loved it! It fits perfectly although it could be just a little bit bigger, but it's good. My size is 9 but I ordered a 9.5. It seems very good quality and waterproof."
The fit was perfect just what we asked for,8.5,Black2,4.0,Haven't worn them yet I'll let you know
"Great warmth, true sizing. Fashion friendly for the east coast.",8,Black3,5.0,My first winter in 22 years in snow.
Excelente,7.5,Black2,5.0,Rapido el envio lo utilizo para trabajar
Warm soft winter boots,7.5 Wide,Black2,5.0,These are warm winter boots with soft inner area. I have not used yet but tried them on and now I am ready for the snow.
Beautiful boots and true to size,6.5,White3,5.0,I like the looks...
7 1/2,7.5 Wide,Black3,3.0,I wear a 61/2 so I ordered a 7 1/2 and still my toes are touching the end
Nice Boot,9,White3,4.0,"This is a nice all around boot. I get a lot of comments when I wear these boots. People say they are really cute and ask me where I got them. I have not submerged them in water but I have been outside in wet environments and they do okay. They are comfortable as far as the fit feels, the size fits true. I wear an 8.5 and 9 in tennis shoes and I purchased the size 9 boot, fits great. They are not the warmest boots, so if it is really cold outside and you know you will be outside for an extended period of time make sure you use a warmer boot. Otherwise, nice overall boot!"
Super soft and warm,8,Black1,4.0,"These boots have good grip, and are super soft with the lining throughout the entire boot. They keep my toes nice and warm, the only thing I think that could make these better is if had sturdier lacing at the top/ calf height like the little metal hooks to keep is snug even at the calf vs. loose."
Bonitas,6,Black2,4.0,No son tan cálidas como dicen
Not cold feet,6.5,White3,5.0,My god this is a macing for snow and they are sooooo pretty I went on vacation to the snow and this boot were the best choice I made!!totally recommend
Had to get half size larger than she normally wears.,8.5 Wide,Black2,4.0,Wife wears an 8 in pretty much any other shoe. That's what we ordered first they were a little tight so we got 8.5 fit perfect. Came quick a day early I believe and that was right before Christmas so that's pretty good. Wife likes them they're warm and comfortable. Get yourself some water proofing spray and they stay dry.
Excelente,7.5,Black3,5.0,Las recomiendo buen precio y el producto es de calidad ..
Perfect!,7.5 Wide,Brown,5.0,These boots are so comfy and easy to get on and off. I wear a 7.5 wide width and these went on easy! I had carpal tunnel surgery so I still struggle with getting shoes on and off. These I can push my feet in and not struggle trying to pull them on or off. The laces are adjustable so you can wear them with your pants inside the boot or pants to go over the boot. The other nice part is they are fit perfect around the top of your calf without any gaps. They keep your feet warm. Haven't had snow or ice yet to try but there's a lot of traction on the bottom and the sole is sturdy. Definitely keeping these on my favorite winter boots list!
Wife friendly,8.5,Black3,4.0,"Got a pair for my wife at Christmas. They are great for many activities where fluid submersions like mud and water are not much of an issue. Not really for hiking and we knew that but she does short flatter day hikes and stays very warm. And I mean warm.
She has a high arch which is problematic when buying shoes but for shorter practical distances she has no problem.
They are also stylish and go well with her jeans and legging pants."
Gorgeous and warm,8.5,White3,5.0,"These boots are awesome! I wore them for the first time the other morning when it was 32 degrees, wind chill 23. Along with a pair of wool lined socks, my feet stayed so warm. I walked for an hour and they never got cold. They also didn't hurt my feet or legs by walking a lot in them. They're super comfortable.

I bought a size larger than what I usually wear in order to be able to wear thick socks, and they fit very well. The laces are long so they're easy to double knot.

There's a deep, thick tread on the bottom to prevent slipping on snow and ice, necessary if you live anywhere with snow and ice. They go almost half way up my thigh, keeping part of my legs warm too. I got the white and they're beautiful.

I'll be getting a lot of use out of these this winter."
Perfect snow boots!,9 Wide,Gray-cam,5.0,I purchased these after moving to Wyoming and realizing that I'd need some. I'm regularly an 8.5 but I got a 9 as I planned on wearing thick socks with them. That gave me enough room for my socks without making it uncomfortable. They have a snug fit that is just right. The inner lining keeps my feet warm all day and the outer layer keep my feet dry. They're very stylish and have earned me tons of compliments. The grips on the bottom have worked well to keep me from slipping and sliding in snow and on ice. Would 100% buy again.
Winter Boots,9 Wide,Black2,4.0,I purchased a pair of these boots in black. They have good traction in snow and are waterproof. The 9 wide fits fine. Support is but average. I do use inserts. They are warm. I wish they were a bit higher. I plan to purchase another pair before the winter season is over as these are very comfortable. .Note: They are made in China.
Keeps your feet warm and dry,8.5,Gray-cam,4.0,"I bought these boots because I do a lot of winter hiking. they did pretty decent on their first 6 miles hike. The grip is not as good as I was expecting going up or down hill but were decent, crossed couple water areas and high snow and my feet stayed dry and warm so that was great but I did noticed although the inside feels soft and warm the soles are not very thick and my feet were a little sore after 6 mil but nothing a pair of insoles can’t fix. Overall I’m pleased with them."
KEEPS UR FEET WARM and dry,9 Wide,White2,5.0,"I wore this to mammoth and i was jumping into snow,puddles ect. They never got wet on the inside. the foux fur is really soft but it changes to a fleece type of fur where your foot is. The boots are medium height."
"Runs large, nice & warm",9,Gray-cam,4.0,"The footbed is too big with no ability to tighten it with the laces, I'm 8.5 & always a 9 in boots. 9 was too big even with thick winter socks. Just needed a quick work boot but I should've known for this price. Other than that they're still great warm winter boots, I'll be using them as winter garden boots instead. Just not great for working or walking all day"
"Great for the snow, just a little rough",7.5 Wide,Black2,4.0,"Great for the snow, really covering, no leaks anywhere. But they are just a little rough when walking, at least for me, I'm 5'2"". For one trip is fine, not if you want to keep them to wear again. And and buy one or two larger size if you are going to use thick socks."
Sure footing!,8 Wide,Black2,4.0,"The tread on these boots is as good or better than it appears in photos. They are warm, comfy and I've worn them in icy conditions (deck stairs, frozen slush). I don't know if I'd want to walk miles in them. But they are perfect for confidently walking the dog in the yard in icy conditions."
Good Purchase,7,Brown,4.0,"I love these boots, they're super cute! I'm a ski racer and was looking for something not too expensive, but comfortable with good grip on the bottom. The main thing I was looking for was a boot with comfortable soles, because after a day of racing and having my feet in ski boots, wearing a good pair of snow boots is all I want. They are easy to slip on, but the inside soles aren't as comfortable as I'd like, but still better than the hard ski boot! I usually wear a size 6.5, and i got the size 7. With thick socks, there is still a little room in them , but not an uncomfortable amount. I really like the bottom of the shoes, they have good ""cleats"" that make it easy to walk in the snow/ice without slipping like my old boots did. I've only had them for a day but so far they've been great, and they are waterproof so far!"
"Easy to put on, comfy, and warm",8.5 Wide,Black2,5.0,"I wear a size 7.5 in women’s but because I have a chunky foot sometimes I need to size up. Bought these in an 8, but they were a bit big I could’ve gone with my normal size. Still comfy though since I used thick socks. They were also easy to put on. I had purchased a different pair and could barely get my foot in through the opening because it was so narrow. These open up but the tongue is secure with elastic so it’s easy to tie up"
Wide is definitely not wide,9 Wide,Black1,4.0,"I have wide feet, so when I saw the 9 wide I was so excited. When I got the boots I was so happy. They're gorgeous! When I put them on I was a little disappointed and confused. They don't fit like a wide. They are actually very snug. What's wide is the tops by the calf area which I love. I hope the foot area will stretch cause I love these boots."
Good boots.,8 Wide,Gray-cam,4.0,"I like these boots. They're fit my wide feet well. It hasn't snowed yet, so I don't know if they're really water resistant. I hope they are. It's hard for me to find comfortable boots because of my wide and flat feet. These feel and fit really well."
Cute boot. Wish there was more support.,8.5 Wide,White2,4.0,"My feet have stayed nice and warm, but they are a little floppy."
Warm,8.5 Wide,White2,4.0,"I love these, I wear 8 1/2 - 9, ordered 9 and they fit nicely with my wool socks. It snowed about 8 inches so far and I was outside for about an hour and my toes were just a bit cold but not freezing. I think I am about to love these! They are very comfy too"
Cute and warm!,8 Wide,Brown,5.0,"They are super warm and the fur lining goes all the way to my toes. The tread is deep and sort of spiky so it looks like they will grip well. I ordered wide so there is plenty of room for my toes. I was able to add my orthotic insoles. They felt comfortable already, but I have plantar fascitis so I wanted more support just in case. The tongue area is thick and soft and is connected to the boot with material, but it expands enough to slip my foot in easily. The other brand I tried the material did not expand enough and it was not as easy to put my foot in. The pink color is very light pink. Cute but I would have liked it a bit darker. I then ordered the back pair and like that color better."
Functional boots,8,Gray-cam,4.0,"Functional boots for rain, the tread has prevented several potential slips for me. I added arch supports to the pair I received so I can walk for hours in them. Need to wear either thermal or heavy socks if you want your feet to be warm. Have not used in snow yet."
Toasty and Dry!,8.5,Black1,5.0,I walk in snow and ice daily in a very cold winter zone and these boots held up beautifully all winter long with no leaks! They are also pretty cute to boot! 🥾
"Nice,",10.5,Black1,4.0,"This boot runs tru to size. I ordered a 10.5, but should have ordered a 10. I wanted room for thick socks, but already built in."
Well made and comfortable,9,Black3,4.0,I didn’t like the ugly company logo name in big bright white letters across the back of shoes otherwise i would’ve kept them
Xtra wide Foot,8.5 Wide,Black2,5.0,I have a hard time finding any boot or shoe to fit my Xtra wide feet. Podiatrist said I needed to have a E or EE size. I ordered by normal size 8.5 in Xtra wide. They fit perfectly and give me the doe area room I need. The size on the box says 8.5MM. Also like that they tie lower on boot but leave me room around top to feel comfortable and allow for tucking pants if needed. The lining is soft and comfortable.
"Not real cute, but worked for what I bought them for…",7.5,Black1,4.0,"Comfortable warm kept my feet dry in the snow. I even used them on my MTB and the grip was very good. Climbed up some wet rocks and they gripped well. They aren’t real cute, but I was looking for warm dry comfy boots and these did the job."
Does well but..,10,White2,4.0,Comcortable. And Does well in the snow with keeping my dry. But doesn't do much to keep my feet warm. My toes get frozen everytime I wear these. Even with warm socks.
Comfortable and warm. Good value!,9 Wide,Gray-cam,5.0,"My shoe size hovers between 8-1/2 and 9, medium width. I chose Wide because of my bulky wool socks and they fit well. Plenty of room but still fit snugly. I’ve not had a chance to wear these in snow or in icy conditions, yet, but temps dropped to 20’sF and my feet stayed comfy and cozy. They’re low enough to wear boot cut or straight leg jeans over them and high enough to tuck skinny jeans in them. Good value and they’re cute!"
They are not true to size,9 Wide,Black2,4.0,"I really needed them for some major snow we got and ice. When I put them on they were to tight but I had no choice I had to wear them in the snow, I didn’t have any other boots."
Just what I needed,7.5,Black1,5.0,"I needed a pair of warm, waterproof boots for walking the dog in the rainy pacific northwest. I usually wear a 7.5 in shoes so that's what size I ordered. They were the right size for my feet. I did put an insole in them just for comfort. I've worn them in driving rain and my feet stay dry. During our recent ice event, I strapped on my YakTrax to take the dog out and my feet stayed warm. I am happy with the boots and they do exactly what I need them to do."
"These are SUPER cute, but…",10,Black3,4.0,"These are super cute, but they DO sag in the center of the boot a bit. : / (even when tied tightly)."
Awesome boots,7,Brown,5.0,"I got these for my daughter for Christmas and they were a home run with her!
After a few days of her wearing them, in the snow, and cold.
I asked her what she thought of them.
She said that they were the most comfortable boots that she has ever worn, and that they supported her foot fantastically and were super cute, and very warm.
So I am super happy with this purchase, because she is super picky about her shoes. 😊"
Comfortable and warm but a little heavy.,9.5,Black2,4.0,Very warm and comfortable.
Really nice boots,8.5 Wide,Black1,5.0,"I usually wear an 8 to 8 and 1/2 boot. I ordered 8 and 1/2 wide so that I would be sure to have room for heavy socks. They fit beautifully with room for the socks. Very soft faux fur lining. Very comfortable, not bulky, fairly lightweight. Very happy with the styling that I chose. I just received the boots today so I haven't had a chance to wear them out in bad weather yet to test warmth and weatherproof but one lady did show a video that showed how waterproof they were. I really like the boots and I would recommend them."
Super durable and cute,9.5,Black2,5.0,"I'm not used to the snowy climate, but I moved to a place thats covered in snow literally all winter!! I searched online, for what felt like days, til I found these. I've gotten SO many compliments-from men AND women- about there boots. I absolutely adore them! Comfy, warm, stylish, and a little wiggle room for thick socks... The fur goes all the way through these boots, so I bought a half size above my norm. They are perfect, and I adore them! Would definitely recommend"
"Nice, but needs new insole",8.5,White2,4.0,"They’re the perfect 8.5! They are terribly uncomfortable to walk in. Throw in a better insole and it would be a 5 star.

I Shelled out a little bit more for a new insole and they’re just fine."
Best winter boots ever,8.5 Wide,Gray-cam,5.0,"These are the best winter boots I've ever owned. They are easy to get on, comfortable and very warm. The dog park I take my dog to has some steep hills and before having these boots, I had to hold onto the fence to prevent falling. No more - the tread on the bottom grips even packed down snow, no more fear of falling. I have purchased a second pair for my daughter."
The quality,6.5,White2,5.0,They are contable and true to size. Love them
Comfortable boot that is cute as well.,7,White3,4.0,"Have not been able to try out since we don't have snow yet. After reading other reviews, I ordered a half size up from my regular size and fits good. Like the treads."
Botas,8 Wide,Black1,4.0,"Muy cómodas pero no me duraron nada, yá se rompieron por debajo...🥺"
Warm☺️,9.5,Black2,4.0,Nice on. Comfortable. Wish they laced up higher on the boot. But they're a keeper.
Cute and comfortable!,8.5,Black1,5.0,"True to size, sometimes boots are iffy but these fit me great (I'm an 8.5 medium in most brands). Very cute and kept me warm in cold weather. I believe they are water resistant, not sure if water proof. So far, very happy and I've worn them several times. Comfy to wear while walking around. Did not rub or blister my feet at all."
Runs slightly large - comfortable.,10.5,Black2,5.0,"These boots were only offered in whole sizes and I'm a 10.5. I read a review that said they run large, so I bought a size 10. When it arrived it said 10.5 on the box. I was wearing thin socks when I tried them on and they were large. Theseboots will be perfect will thicker socks.
I had previously bought a pair of Columbia brand boots and my feet felt unstable with them and I sent them back. These boots are perfectly supportive and comfortable. I am very happy with them and the price was very reasonable."
Not Waterproof !!!!!!,10.5,Black2,5.0,"Very disappointed these are NOT WATERPROOF at all.
I got these a 1/2 size bigger and they fit good. I like my shoes in wide width but they don't offer that so I got them a half size bigger ... Otherwise they would be very tight and my toes go to the tip of boot. They kinda run small...."
Warm and Cozy!,9.5,White3,5.0,"They are everything everyone is saying about them! They are comfortable, warm and cozy! I just moved to an area where there's a ton of snow and ice and I have to say these boots perform GREAT! They keep my feet warm and dry. They grip the snow and ice pretty good. Overall I am very happy with this purchase and for the price you can't beat it!"
Great pair of warm boots!,9.5,Gray-cam,4.0,Very stylish and comfortable! There's fur throughout the boot. I'm very happy with my decision to get these. I'm going to buy another pair for my Mother!
Great quality,10.5,White3,5.0,"Great quality winter boots - fit is maybe a tiny bit small so I'm grateful I ordered half a size up to easily adjust with additional insoles as desired or thick socks .....otherwise the lacing makes them easy to adjust, the inside lining really does go all inclusive even on the foot part which I love, light weight and comfortable. Great value for the price, the outsole also provides good tracking and is of great quality. Arrived in a timely manner and good condition....and they're really cute;-))
Would really recommend;-))"
Very comfortable!,9.5,Black2,5.0,"These have been great work boots for deliveries in the snow. Warm & fuzzy on the inside, waterproof on the outside, the tread has been great on the ice, and my feet don't hurt by the end of my shift. They've been very comfortable, would definitely recommend."
Needs better material,8.5 Wide,White3,3.0,"These fit me well. My feet do get cold if I am outside on a cold day more then 15 minutes. One of the boots the top layer is chipping off, I am hoping that these boots will last the rest of the winter as I would hate to have to buy another set of boots.

On the plus side the boots seems to do well on the ice. I am not slipping as much as I would if I was not using boots with the spikes on the bottom."
Comfy,9.5,Black2,5.0,Stayed warm and dry.
Perfect,6,Black1,5.0,These are the best boots that I have bought for snow and a really long time I have purchased these to go to Arkansas where I knew the weather was going to be about 10ﾟ I stepped in puddles and played in snow and my feet remained dry and warm the entire time They fit really well even With thick will socks
Great boots.,6,Black1,5.0,I defintely recommend this boots is you are going to the snow. I sunk with boots into the snow deep to my knees. And yet my feet and socks stayed dried. Water never really got in to the boot. They were comfortable and definitely didn't feel heavy in your foot. And they look stylish as well.
Good fit,8.5 Wide,Black2,5.0,I have bad feet and these feel great
Attractive looking size right but..,8,Black3,3.0,This is a nice boot but I found it to be a very stiff hard sole and not flexible enough when walking.
Runs small,8,Black3,4.0,Ordered up 1/2 size. Still too tight
Great boots,9.5,Black5,5.0,"Play Video
 I loved it! It fits perfectly although it could be just a little bit bigger, but it's good. My size is 9 but I ordered a 9.5. It seems very good quality and waterproof."
Very comfortable and half sizes,10.5,Black4,5.0,"Mu main objective of purchasing these boots because of the half sizes offered. I purchased a similar boot in a size 11, very uncomfortable. I ""tried it before I bought it"", perfect fit! Just enough room for me to wear thick socks without the boot being too bulky.

I will surely purchase another pair, I wish they offered a brown/tan option.

Overall great boot so far."
True to size and warm enough,7.5,Black5,5.0,"I was looking for boots that would be warm and not short, and not expensive. These suit me. I hope they will serve well. They are true to size, and fit my skinny feet. I've chosen size 7.5. (not wide)"
Boots,10.5,Gray-cam,1.0,Very uncomfortable
Not easy to put on,7.5 Wide,White-1,2.0,The shoe tongue is attached to the shoe and not open like most tongues. This makes the shoe harder to put on .
2 LEFT BOOTS,7.5,White-0,1.0,I bought my boots a year ago but I just tried them on for a trip and I have 2 left boots. My trip was cancelled last year so I never needed until now. Is there anything I can do?
Yes!!,9.5,Black1,5.0,"Gorgeous! Super cute, super comfy, very soft fur that goes is on the entire inside of the boot!!! Get a ½ size bigger than what you usually wear.. I'm a true 9, but remember, in the winter you're more than likely gonna wear thicker socks. I got a 9½ and they for PERFECTLY!!"
Great lookingt...but runs large,7,White3,4.0,"These look like wonderful, comfortable boots...but they run very large. Even with heavy winter socks on (which I don't need because the boots are so well insulated), they were still at least 1/2 size too big."
Cute; length is sized right for USA; made in China.,9.5,Gray-cam,5.0,"Size I ordered is exactly 1/2 up from my regular size to allow for winter socks.
If you need a wide toe box this boot isn’t for you (or me). I have a neuroma and can’t tolerate my toe area being pressed on. I got them for active wear, hiking and snowshoeing, live in snow so these aren’t for me.
Otherwise they feel nice. No weird inside rubbing as I’ve found in other boots. Very comfy.
I got black fir on black boot. Pretty. The fur isn’t too fluffy. It’s obviously synthetic but still cute.
Great tread.
Easy to get on and off.
I need to return these but really like them."
Fashionable,7.5 Wide,White2,2.0,Look good and ok for general walking during the winter but not for being outside for long periods of time as these are not insulated well.
Entrega rápida,7,Gray-cam,5.0,"Se ven muy bien, pedí 1 número más, ya que ñas usaré con medias gruesas, ya quiero usarlas, se sienten confortables"
Comfortable,7,Black1,5.0,My last pair of snow boots finally had to go to the trash after more than ten years. I loved my old pair and never thought I would find any I love as much. These come very close.
Used boots,8.5,Black3,1.0,Sent a pair of obviously used boots. Returned
Not cold feet,6.5,White3,5.0,"Play Video
 My god this is a macing for snow and they are sooooo pretty I went on vacation to the snow and this boot were the best choice I made!!totally recommend"
True to size,7.5,Black2,1.0,Feet get wet
Boots,8,Black2,5.0,Works great in lots of snow
Don't waste your money,10.5,Gray-cam,1.0,These boots were so poorly made. They did not even last a month. They are so thin. And before the month was out it was cracks in the soles of the shoe so they are not weather and winterproof please do not waste your money
Awesome snow boot,9,Black2,5.0,These snow boots are very comforting and warm. I am really happy that I got them. They keep my feet warm and easy to walk in the snow
Fits well,9 Wide,White2,5.0,"Works for me.
Wore these in snow and rain.
Lots of compliments.
More important, they fit!"
Love my boots !,6,Black1,5.0,"Very well make, great size and very comfortable"
Very nice,9.5,White3,5.0,"True to size. I wasn’t sure and ordered half size too large, should have ordered my size. Pretty and warm."
Son cómodos,9,Black2,5.0,Son excelente y muy cómodos
Botas para nieve,7,Black3,5.0,"Super cómodas, igual a la foto que muestran. Solo que no son antiderrapantes o al menos no como yo esperaba. Buena calidad 👌"
Keep feet nice and warm,8.5,Gray-cam,5.0,"Worked as advertised, keep feet warm and had good traction"
Snow boots,9.5,Gray-cam,5.0,Fit good. Light in weight. Warm short term in our doors. If you're hiking for a long length of time I would purchase a heavier line boot but these are great around town
Not true to size,8 Wide,Black2,5.0,I ordered size 8 and had to return them because they were too small. Go 1/2 bigger. Nice looking boots.
Hmmm Pass,9,Black3,2.0,"There is zero support in this boot. I would not recommend them. They look great and super cute, but that's it. It's like there is no sole inside the fury lining of the boot. Very disappointed."
Quality is great.,9.5,Black2,5.0,These boots are very good quality and are very warm. Well worth the money.
Comfy,10,Black2,5.0,"Very comfortable, keeps my feet warm and manages ice and snow well."
Great boots,9 Wide,Gray-cam,5.0,I really have liked these boots. I got the wide option and they are really comfy even with thick socks.
"Warm, soft and very comfortable.",6.5,Black2,5.0,Fits to size I recommend them no regrets perfect.
Nice Boots,10.5,Black1,5.0,I bought these because of the nice tread. Fortunately we hardly had any snow in NY this year...I only wore them once. They are comfortable and warm.
"Not water proof, no support, awful.",9 Wide,Gray-cam,1.0,"Terribly uncomfortable, not water proof, nothing good about these. Seemed good the first couple of times they were worn. After being worn maybe 2 or 3 times a week simply to use in the snow during winter to get to and from my vehicle they have completely deteriorated. They felt like they had support in the beginning but now feel as though I am walking on lumps of cardboard. If I wear them in the snow by the time I get to work a 10 minute drive away and through the snow to my work my feet are soaked and I have to change socks and shoes. Absolutely terrible I would not recommend these to anyone looking for a good winter boot."
Great,8.5 Wide,Gray-cam,5.0,I bought these for when I was going to Kentucky to visit my kids and grandchildren and they were super comfy and kept my feet warm and dry!
Love these,9 Wide,Black3,5.0,These are my favorite snow boots & that says a lot because I have a lot! I always get compliments with these. They are comfy & warm.
So cute,9.5,White2,5.0,These boots feel like I am walking on clouds. They are really cute also!
Are not that warm,9.5,Black2,3.0,"I dont think these are warm at all, bought to be outside feet are cold"
Love them!,7.5 Wide,Black1,5.0,Great price quality relationship !
Already not waterproof,6.5,Black3,1.0,I bought them in January and already they are no longer waterproof very disappointed
Very warm!,9,Black3,5.0,The only problem I have had is the little insole inside comes loose and wants to come out with your foot every time you wear them. This should be sewn in or at least attached a little bit better
The best snow boots,8,Black2,5.0,I’ve spent $$$$ on snow boots in the past. I couldnt believe the price of these and figured they wouldnt be great. BUT they’re the best boots I’ve ever owned!!!
Great for walks in the snow.,9,Gray-cam,5.0,Bought these for the traction. Great buy!
Too tight for the top of my foot. Lace,7.5 Wide,Black1,4.0,Top of foot area too tight tight before the laces started so not able to adjust. Felt great and loved the look but just too tight for my feet.
Perfect!,9,White3,5.0,"These are perfect for the snow. The grips on the bottom help to dig into the snow so there's no fear of slipping/sliding. I wore them for a week in Montana, they were comfortable and my feet stayed dry."
Love these boots,8.5,Black2,5.0,"Good tread. I slipped last year in my Iggs and hurt my back so I bought these the bottom has good grip, they are also wide and comfortable. For the price they were really comfortable."
Love these boots!,6,Black3,5.0,I got these boots for walking dogs and other outdoor adventures. They are comfy and warm! I do not plan to use them for all day wear unless I will be outside most of the day. My feet would be too warm! I did go up half a size to allow for thicker socks. I'm glad I did.
LOVE THESE!,8.5,Gray-cam,5.0,"These are so warm and soft and comfortable inside. The style is great and it is water resistant. I did put rain and stain on them before I wore them the first time.
I love these as a 50 + year old
And my daughters who are early twenties love these as much as I do!
I highly recommend these and will be getting more for my daughters."
Met My Expectations!!!,9 Wide,Black2,5.0,"This snow boot was extremely comfortable, warm and wide fit which is why I selected this particular snow boot. It was also a very handsome boot, far more than I expected! Yes, this boot has good quality and cute with safe gripping underfoot in the snow. Fast delivery! I’m very pleased with this product! I definitely highly recommend!!!"
All-day every-day wear.,8,Black1,5.0,"These boots are very confortable. Can be wear all day every day. My niece wears a 7.5 but I bought an 8, she said if not, she would not have been able to wear them all day (from 5am until midnight sometimes). She is in Nevada, had walked 40mins. during a winter storm, and her feet were kept warm and dry."
Amazing!,7.5 Wide,White-0,5.0,"High quality boot at an affordable price. Super cute! Comfy as could be! Warm, practical, great arch support, you won’t regret buying them. I’m also always between a 7-7.5 because I have a wide foot so I opted for the 7.5 wide so I could also have a thick sock on if so desired and so happy with the fit."
love these cozy boots,10,Black1,5.0,"these boots are a fabulous value, and they look really cute. They fit as expected. I added my power step inserts and they fit like a glove. I highly recommend them I do live in California, so it does not get the weather that some states get so take that into consideration."
Traction!,7.5,White-0,5.0,"These boots hold up to Wisconsin cold really all. The lining fake fur is really warm. The traction is great in snow and icy sidewalks, they are like a trail running shoe sole. The fit is roomy and the lacing really controls the fit, I have narrow feet, but feel like there is lots of room. I have them laced up tight. The styling is pretty nice, I got the white ones with plaid in the back and sort of a matte sueded
Cream surface. No mistaking this for a $200 boot up close, but on the move they had my friends asking about who made them and where to get!
Most importantly they are very comfortable and have a bit of cute vibe to them. Great value."
Daughter loves them,8,Black2,5.0,Daughter wore them to the snow this past weekend. She LOVED them. She said that they are comfortable and fashionable. She was only in the snow with them for 30 minutes but she said that they were warm and I sprayed them with water repellent spray before we went but I don't know that I had to.
So happy to find a boot in a wide width!,8.5 Wide,Black3,5.0,So hard for me to find a boot that fits my wide feet and even harder to find ones that fit around my thick ankles. These fit both! Lace up snug with plenty of room for my pants to tuck in and still could fit a thicker leg than mine! Just in time for a winter trip to Alaska! Very comfortable right out of the box!
Very comfortable,9.5,Black1,5.0,I recently moved to a colder climate and realized I had A bunch of boots that did not keep me warm. That was never a factor before. I am so glad I discovered these boots! They are very comfortable and appear to be well made. I have worn them in the snow and they keep my feet very warm.
Great traction and super warm!,8.5,Black1,5.0,These boots are exactly what I wanted. I wear a size 8 but got an 8.5 for extra room for big socks. I have a pair of wool socks on now and they have enough room for bigger but are still comfortable. The traction is great and I look forward to hiking even more now that I have these boots!
Perfect winter boots,7.5 Wide,Black2,5.0,Love love love these boots and came just before snow fall. I'm in the Midwest and they keep my feet warm in single digit weather. Should get another pair so not to wear this pair out.
"Super cute, comfy and functional!",8 Wide,White3,5.0,"LOOOOVVVEEEEE these boots! The quilting on these boots is so cute! The fur on the inside is like a walk in the clouds!!!! These are the only shoes I took on vacation and wore them with everything! Jeans, dresses, even my bikini while at the spa! These are a winner 100%"
Love love live,7.5 Wide,White3,5.0,These boots are warm and roomy. No problem wearing my thick thermal socks. They look great also. I get a lot of compliments on them.
Love these boots!,8.5,Brown,5.0,"Not only are these boots super cute, they are comfortable & warm. I’ve even had someone stop me & ask where I got these boots because she loved them too. I loved them so much, I ended but buying another pair in a different color!"
My winter boots,8 Wide,Gray-cam,5.0,"Very nice boots, very warm. I order a wide and a size bigger than I wear cause boots are not like most shoes. But I had to go back to my old shoes cause the top of my foot is swollen from wearing them. But I still love them and the fur all on the inside is so nice."
Perfect for snow trip,10.5,Black1,5.0,"Got these boots for a ski trip, and it was beautiful, comphy and perfect, and most favorite piece of my outfit the whole time"
Warm and Comfortable for Minnesota Cold,9 Wide,Black3,5.0,"These boots are warm, comfortable and lightweight. They keep my feet warm in minus 25 degree Minnesota cold weather and my feet stay dry in wet snow."
"Super comfortable, warm and good grip",6,Gray-cam,5.0,"Fits well, super soft and warm. The bottom grip is really good. I did not feel like I was going to slip at all while my mother went down in her borrowed UGGs."
Wonderful product,7.5,Black2,5.0,I got these boots because I needed added snow and ice protection. I’m very pleased with the quality of the boot tread and the different angles and groves that give extra traction.
They are really nice I'm happy with my choice,8,Black2,5.0,"We are from Virginia beach , we went hunting for snow since we never need boots we had to buy some for our adventure. I am so happy I choice these.. they are warm they look awesome there soft and they keep my feet dry. Awesome"
"Great look, good fit!",6.5,Black1,5.0,"Perfect winter shoes!! None slipping on ice, warm, waterproof for sure and the fitting is perfect even with thermal socks on! For those that hate the cold like I do, definitely worth a buy. I got a 6.5!"
So warm,8 Wide,White-0,5.0,"I love these boots. So many boots are weatherproof, but not warm. These are both! I love the bottom, the snow doesn’t get packed underneath. First boots I’ve actually loved!"
loved these....were perfect for the snow & cold weather,9.5,Black1,5.0,"I bought these on a whim....was headed to Idaho to ski.....& I was on the fence......
They are comfortable.....& got tons of compliments on them.....wear them with jeans and with leggings.....would get these again in a heart beat!"
Cómodos para la nieve,6.5,Black1,5.0,Súper buenos y cómodos ! Además te ayuda mucho para el frío me encanta
Look and feel great,10.5,White2,5.0,"Bought these for an upcoming trip to Iceland. I typically wear a size 10.5-11 in shoes, so I bought the 10.5 and they fit great. There's plenty of room in there left to accommodate for thick socks.
Love them so far. Will update after the trip"
Great boots,9 Wide,Black1,5.0,These boots are great. I have wide feet and also need a wide toe space and this boot checked all boxes for comfort. It is a very attractive boot!
So comfy and warm,10.5,Black1,5.0,"I visited Alaska and these boots kept my feet nice and warm for what I needed them for. Did not spend much time in the snow or even outside, but my feet were warm in -20 degrees."
Very comfortable purchased white and they fit perfectly. Love them,8 Wide,Black2,5.0,"Ordered black, same size as the white, and they were tight in the toes, so I returned to get a 1/2 bigger"
Delieved to the wrong apartment,9 Wide,White-1,5.0,"The boots fit perfectly n very stylish. My complaint is Amazon should make the drivers take a course in hoe to make a delivery in a large apartment complex.
My order went to another apartment n I didn't receive them until the next day."
"Cozy, comfortable and stylish",8,Black2,5.0,"""I recently purchased this snow boot and I have to say, I'm thoroughly impressed! These boots are incredibly warm and cozy, thanks to the plush lining and sturdy insulation. I've worn them on several snowy hikes already and my feet have stayed dry and toasty every time.

The boots are also very comfortable to wear, with a cushioned footbed and a secure, adjustable fit. The laces and zip closure make it easy to get the boots on and off, while the grippy sole provides great traction on slippery surfaces.

I appreciate the attention to detail in the design of these boots, too. The exterior is made of a durable, waterproof material that repels snow and slush, and the stylish faux fur collar adds a touch of flair. Overall, these snow boots have exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend them to anyone in need of a warm, reliable pair of winter boots!"""
So cute,9 Wide,White2,5.0,"First, everyone takes one look and says they are cute! But importantly, I have trouble with cold feet, and they do pretty decent. I’ve had a boot or two in my life that were cozy warm, but you can’t find them again when you need them.
I find these boots comfy and warm."
Wife loves them,9.5,Black1,5.0,Wife loves them
"Super comfy, warm and stylish!",6,Black2,5.0,"I got these boots before a trip to the Michigan's Upper Penninsula the last weekend in February. They arrived just a few days before my trip so I put them on to break them in but honestly... they didn't need any breaking in. They are very flexible, comfortable and extremely warm. And they aren't really clunky or heavy. The tread on the bottom is very well done. I usually wear a size 8 but they were out of my size so I got size 7.5 Wide and they were PERFECT! Worth the money and highly recommend. Also fast shipping"
Cozy,8,Gray-cam,5.0,Warm and cozy inside. Looks like the sole will be durable.
Excelentísima,8,Gray-cam,5.0,Veryyyy well

Warm,10.5,Black2,5.0,"I love this. 1st snow boots.
Makes feel powerful. Like I can step on anything and crush anything."
Great Snow Bood,9,Black3,5.0,"Purchased a size 9 and they fit as expected (even with thick socks). The boot is very comfortable and felt like I was wearing a tennis shoe. Fur lining kept my feet very warm and comfortable. I used them for snow tubing, and they were great. The conditions were icy, and I was able to walk comfortably on the ice, while others were slipping. Very happy with this purchase."
Great boots.,7.5 Wide,Black1,5.0,Easy on and off. Comfortable.
GREAT tread. Warm. Cute.,9 Wide,Black2,5.0,"Very roomy around foot. I do have to lace them a bit tighter to take up the space on top of foot (and I have wide feet), but they are cute! Wish the leg length was just a bit shorter, but others may prefer that. Good fit lengthwise. The only thing that would make them better is if they had a side zipper so they could be slipped in more quickly. Appear to be quite waterproof, though not fully tested on that yet."
Great product,7,White3,5.0,Great shoes. Look nice and good price

Comfortable Fiy,8 Wide,White3,4.0,"Come in wide width which is helpful. Stylish and has warm lining which will be helpful in colder weather. Will hopefully be waterproof, have not worn them in rain or snow yet to verify. Just wish they came up a bit higher"

Muy bonitos me encantaron,7.5,White2,4.0,Hermosas
Order to exact size,10,White2,4.0,The only problem I had was the size. The boots were super comfy and warm.
So far so good,6.5,Black1,4.0,Daughter just got these and so far they seem pretty good. The inside is comfy and fuzzy but have not put them to use yet. Tried them on and they fit VERY snug with just regular socks. Daughter is a size 6 usually but ordered a 6.5 and there was not much room for a thicker sock. Will have to return and try size 7 so there will be an update to this review.
Good boots but don’t keep your feet warm,,,4.0,They are comfortable enough and seem to be waterproof. Not very warm. The one thing I didn’t like at all is the shoelace holes stop before the top lining of fur. I had to poke holes so I could tie all the way to the top.
They are good!,7.5,White2,4.0,"They are comfortable but after walk too much starting to feel heavy
Very warm and dry
But they are really big, if you are looking something for use during normal days this one aren't the perfect ones, they are more for a trip to the snow"
Definitely Perfect winter boots comfy & warm!!!,8,Black3,4.0,"Disappointed that there so loose, but I’ll definitely keep them! I live in NORTHERN ILLINOIS & it snows crazy! The boots are very nice, keeps my feet warm,& dry! But they flop cause there so loose! Beautiful Boots, thanks!!🙁"
Love them.. but…,8,Gray-cam,4.0,"These boots are fabulously warm and wonderful! BUT… they pull my socks down when I walk.. or even as I sit.. The slightest movement of my foot and my socks ride down. Now, I bought new socks! Still rides down.. idk hoe to solve this issue.. Kinda of a real bummer!"
Used in 0 degree weather and worked okay,10,White-0,4.0,These boots are fairly comfortable and did keep my feet dry. I was able to wear 3 pair of socks with them in the 0 degree weather to make sure my feet stayed warm. They are true to size
"So Comfy, and cute !!",7,White2,4.0,These boots are so warm and made with very good quality. I dont usually by shoes from Amazon but I needed new boots I didn't want to leave in the snow. So I am very pleased with these BOOTS :)
"Look nice, good quality, run short",7,Black3,4.0,"Very pretty boots for walking outdoors, cozy! But run short. I wear a size 6.5, I ordered a 7 and my toes touch front. Order full size up at least. Would have exchanged but I needed them ASAP."
The boot came apart.,10.5,Brown,4.0,The 👢 bottom separated from the sole and my feet got wet.
Great buy!,10.5,Brown,4.0,I really like these boots. They fit well and are warm. The only downside is I wish that they laced up higher on the boot.
Love them,,,4.0,They are perfect for me. I am able to tuck my pants into them and they are not uncomfortable. They are perfect for the snow and so far they keep my feet warm. I like these better then the more expensive boots that I purchased in the past. Great buy
Cute but no arch support,7,Black2,4.0,Very cute! I purchased one size larger for my daughter and added an arch support insert so the flatness wouldn’t hurt her feet.
where is comes from,8,Gray-cam,4.0,I think you need to go up a half size they run a little narrow
Comfortable,10,Brown,4.0,Great Boots...they are comfortable..easy to wear..very stylish...

Perfect fit!,8 Wide,Black2,4.0,"I have trouble buying shoes because of the width of my foot, and almost never buy online because of it. I took a chance because I needed boots, and I'm glad I did! These fit great and are super comfy! They are fur lined and warm, but haven't experienced super cold or snow yet. Good traction on the bottom. I only wish the laces went up just a snide higher, but that's personal preference as they tie up well and stay on perfectly!"
Right big toe side cut too much,9.5,Brown,4.0,I love these boots The footbed on the right foot is cut too narrow I’ll have to go up a size

Nice but...,7.5,White-1,4.0,"This is a cute, lightweight boot with lots of room and comfort inside HOWEVER it does not lace all the way up so for me it left open gaps at the top for snow to enter the boot. I sadly had to return them"
Nice looking and warm,7,White-1,4.0,I like the look. They are a little stiff but I’m sure they will break-in
Very nice in all ways except wide in the heels. I wd prefer a narrow heeled version,9.5,Black3,4.0,See above
Great snowboot,9,Black1,4.0,I liked the way it fit they didn’t weigh me down love their waterproof and nice to look at
Super cute - Order half size down,7.5,White2,4.0,Ordered a 7 1/2 per my normal womens shoe size - they were a half to maybe a full size too big. Lots of space even with snow socks. Very cute tho!!
Not as Waterproof as Claimed,8,Black1,3.0,"I like these boots, they are comfortable, they have great traction, and they look nice. They are a little bigger than I expected, so now they crease in an odd spot, and make a strange popping noise when I walk. They are also not fully waterproof. My toes get wet as soon as the snow melts off. Which has caused some very cold toes, especially when we had -25 degree weather. These boots would be perfect if not for those 2 issues."
Not for fresh snow,6,Black2,3.0,"Comfortable, good traction in the snow, and very cute. I had two pair of socks on. My feet only stayed warm in the snow for about 45 min. them my toes started getting terribly cold. These are probably good for walking on flat worn snow not fresh snow when your boot sinks into the snow."
Great but purchased modifications!,6.5,Gray-cam,3.0,"Nice boot! I was hoping for a bit more cushion and support, so I purchased an insole and they worked great! (Paired with thick wool socks) I don’t wear the boots everyday, just when I go to the snow or cold. Worked great walking the streets of NY in winter!"
"No es impermeable para nieve, y me resbalo en el hielo",7,Black2,3.0,"Es impermeable hasta cierto punto pero no si caminas por la nieve por mucho tiempo, si caminas por el hielo de igual manera te puedes llegar a resbalar, lo bueno es que sin cómodas y tienen peluche por dentro, muy abrigadoras"
Too small or too big for me. Bummer.,9,Black3,3.0,"True size, too small. Size up, waaaaay too big. My feet are maybe slightly more narrow than typical medium with. These boots are so roomy, I would need to wear 2-3 papers of socks. If you’re going to do that, they’ll be great for you. Since they don’t fit me, I can’t comment on comfort, etc."
Too wide for my feet,9.5,Black2,3.0,"I really liked the look of these boots and the treads looked really good, however, the fit was way too wide for my feet even with extra thick socks, so I returned them. I think they would probably be a good boot for women with medium width feet, but not narrow. I returned them."
"Wanted to like them, but meh",9.5,Gray-cam,3.0,"Got a size 9.5, as every other winter boot has been too small (i wear a 9 in EVERY shoe and boot). These were too large. When i finally found the size indicator, it's a euro 43 (which is nowhere near a 9/euro 41) They're cute boots, but not that comfortable either. I'm debating trying again, but it has been such a hassle already. I'm not sure risking them not knowing size conversion or that these are of the best quality is worth attempting an echange. The sole looks good (traction and tread depth). I'll update if i try another pair. Maybe i'll contact the seller directly."
Comfort,8.5 Wide,Black1,3.0,Foot kept sliding toward toe of boot otherwise it was a nice boot and otherwise comfortable as well
Not very warm,8.5 Wide,Gray-cam,3.0,"Narrow front but cute look. Pretty good tread but not magic. Ice is still ice. Though better traction than most. My toes were so cold though, couldn't keep them."
"Warm especially with wool socks, leaks where rubber meets poly material",9,White-0,3.0,"Dislike: leaks where rubber meets the poly material so feet will get wet on the sides if walking through slush or some water or if snow melts in that area.

Likes: warm, I ordered 1 size bigger then normal (I'm 8/8.5 shoe ordered 9 boot to accommodate thicker socks and fit perfect). Like the style too. If I didn't need it for snow/outdoor use and just sit in a hockey rink they would likely work just fine (not sure since didn't have that opportunity)

If it didn't leak through sides right above rubber I would keep. (Wife's review since for her)"
Leaked dirt tie out.,9.5,Black2,3.0,Returned they leaked the first time out after about 5 minutes my feet were wet.
Boots,7,White2,3.0,Extra room
Purchased new but they came looking used,8,Brown,3.0,"These boots fit really well and are honestly very cute in person once they arrive, but the pair that I got already had scuff marks on the front of the boot where the toes would bend and what seemed like some light use on the bottom of the boots. :( Wish they would’ve been new like I’d purchased, I’ll probably return them."
Slightly water resistant,8.5,Black1,3.0,They did fit well and quite comfortable but my biggest thing. As far as waterproof not even close. I would say slightly water resistant but don't go trekking through snow that is higher than 4 inches and expect your feet to keep dry
size of boot after added lining,8,Black-cam,3.0,"I wear a size 7 wide so I ordered a size 8. However the thick lining, which was great, still made the boot too tight. I like the design and it did feel warm but I just can't wear them."
"Size is not true, way too big!",10.5,White-0,3.0,"The size is way too large. Ordered a half size larger to fit wool socks, they are huge, too big to wear. Difficulty in returning....."
Really liked these boots but,8.5,Black2,3.0,The inside was just to hard. Couldn't see wearing them for long like that. Returned them
Color as shown in the images,8,Brown,3.0,"Gift for daughter. She is a difficult shoe buyer, so this was a bonus."
Cute but not warm,9,White3,3.0,"The boots fit true to size and come as pictured. However, they are not very warm. I wore fuzzy socks with them and my feet FROZE while we visited Colorado. They are super cute and look nice, but do not buy them for warmth."
It's good,9.5,Black-cam,3.0,It rubs the top of my ankle
"Super cute, but not warm",8.5,Black1,3.0,"Super cute and stylish, but doesn’t keep feet warm in snow. Size was about 1/2 size bigger."
Redefine waterproof,9.5,White2,3.0,If snow or water gets on top by the laces my feet get wet
Very warm,,,3.0,"Very warm, but don't like the way they fit."
Not for cold just snow,10,White-0,2.0,"For the Snow these boots work really nice, however to tops don’t prevent snow from getting in, so you will have to put your pants over the tops. Just for a walking in snow for style and comfort they work fine.
For the Cold. It got to 27 degrees and going from a car to building they work, but playing outside or shoveling you would still need to buy wool socks to keep warm.
For the cold, buy wool lined boots and you won’t need the wool socks.
It’s a good boot, keeps water out, soft and comfortable, just not outside long periods of a time without wool socks. For that i would just buy wool lined boots."
Frozen toes in early winter,8 Wide,Gray-cam,2.0,"I ordered these before the deep cold of winter would hit here in Minnesota. When temperatures first fell to around 15 - 20 degrees (practically warm to some here) I found out right away these boots did not provide warmth protection. I tried wearing multiple pairs of socks and still had issues with my toes hurting after walking my dog due to cold. These should be advertised for mild climate (above 30 degrees).

The boot was also very big even after adding additional support. I originally kept them figuring I could balance out the size. Heed the advice of the others and size down. I also have wide feet so I didn’t think they would be too big."
Disappointed,8,White3,2.0,"When I first bought these boots, I loved them. Very comfortable and perfect for cold snowy weather.

Unfortunately in less than 2 months, the right boot started leaking from the bottom and it's too late to return or replace them..."
They are good comfortable,10.5,Black2,2.0,"Really comfortable, I have a wide feet, plus they get swelling easy and this was perfect, and it wasn't even for wide feet, but sometimes My feet were freezing..."
Doesn't last long,8,Black1,2.0,The yellow part of the underside of the boot started to get holes in them and water started to get into the boot.
Not waterproof,8.5 Wide,Gray-cam,2.0,I purchased these shoes for the snow. We finally had a storm and 1/2 through my walk my foot was wet. Not waterproof :(
My feet were cold.,9,Black3,2.0,"The boots look very nice. However, the fur inside the boot is not as thick as one may think so they are not warm. I had double socks and my feet were still cold."
Snow Boots,8.5 Wide,Black1,2.0,"With the title snow boots , I thought they would be good for the cold but they are not. I bought them because I work in a refrigerated kitchen that is at 37 degrees and my feet were numb working for 10 hours in the cold. They are nice looking but not good for the cold at long periods of time."
Not waterproof,9,Black1,2.0,Im a mail carrier and got these i. Hopes my feet would stay dry. These unfortunately do the opposite and my feet get wet.
Not For The Snow,8.5 Wide,Black2,2.0,"Thought a snow boot would help in the snow, but that didn't happened. I still slipped and feet was wet. Not what I was expecting."
Boots suck,8,Gray-cam,2.0,This boots are not warm or water resistant. I'm very disappointed! My feet are freezing right now!!
Do not keep feet warm,10,White3,2.0,"Bought these seeing as how they are snow boots. I wore them outside a few times, not even in snow and with 2 pairs of wool socks. My feet were numb they were so cold. Not sure how these are supposed to keep your feet even a little warm."
STRANGE FIT-RETURNED.,7.5,Black3,2.0,These were cool but no size up or down would have fit. They slipped on the heel but jammed my toes. I have no problem fitting into a size 7.5 or 8 with good fitting shoes. It's too bad because they are cute.
uncomfortable,6,Black1,2.0,"Maybe it's just me, but they are very uncomfortable"
Too small,7.5,White-1,2.0,I am typically a size 7 however since this was a boot I ordered an 8; which was so small on my feet my toes were crunched up. Did not return since I had walked to my mailbox in them.
Lots of blisters!,9 Wide,Black3,2.0,The back of the boot rubs badly and causes blisters. Painful.
"Not comfortable, nothing like Danskos",9.5,Gray-cam,2.0,This is warm and has great traction. I was trying for something like a Dansko boot but my feet hurt and my back hurts. I have been spoiled with Danskos and I found these listed among the Danskos. Not even close.
Tienen eficiencia,7.5,Black3,2.0,Excelente
Not satisfied,7.5,Black1,2.0,I bought these cause they looked good and had some nice reviews. My feet freeze in these and don’t fit right. Won’t buy again
Pass these up,9,Black2,2.0,Cheap and not waterproof at all! Pass on these and buy something better
Came damaged but too much of a hassle to return,9.5,Black1,2.0,Very stiff and fur missing.
There not as solid of a boot as I had hoped,9,Black1,2.0,They need to be more sturdy.
I like,9,Black3,2.0,I like
Meh,7.5,White2,2.0,They are warm but they do not look as good as the picture.
For me the 9.5 felt like a 9,8.5,White2,2.0,It ran small for me even though it was my size shoe but I love the style
"Will keep ur feet warm ,but not made for walking long distance",8.5,White2,2.0,They are not comfortable at all u can feel everything when u walk
How it fits,10.5,White-1,2.0,Too big
Super slippery in winter...so what's the point?,8.5,Gray-cam,2.0,"These boots are cute, warm, and comfortable. But in MN, all I do is slip when I wear them. Why make boots that have no traction? I guess I'll wear them when there isn't any ice or snow, but it's still cold?"
After wearing these a few times they fall apart,8.5,Black1,2.0,Ok so after wearing these a handful of times they start falling apart they are NOT WATERPROOF and the laces don't go up far enough to actually keep the tounge in place but they have Good traction. Have to say I'm really disappointed with these boots
Women's Snow boots,8.5 Wide,White-0,2.0,"Just got these boots here. I can't believe it, I ordered a 9W and I still can not get my foot in past the arch of my foot. Must be made in China alright. If i order again in these in in other boots, I guess im going to size 10W. If a 9W wide does not fir then i know a 9.5 won't fit my wide feet. SO sad it's the 3rd pair of winter boots I have ordered since October this year. If these 10W don't fit I guess I'll go shopping at a regular store. I'm hoping I get a 10 but they do not come in W that that the boots will fit my wide feet. If not, well I guess I go store shopping in person.

Elaine M."
Wrong size,8.5,White2,2.0,I love the boots. They are really cute and seem to be well made BUT they are WAAYYYYY to big. I ordered 8.5 boots after looking all over the boots the only # I found was 41..I looked at the photos on Amazon and discovered 41 is a size 10!! Makes sense why they are to big.
Don't like,8.5,Black1,2.0,"Don't like, not comfortable"
Runs small,9,Black1,2.0,The size runs small I wear a 9.5 to a 10 and it was more like a 8.5
Not waterproof!,8.5,White3,2.0,"I work outside and I use these boots for work. These boots are so comfortable and stylish. I had to work in the rain and even the fur on the boots didn’t get soaked. They are truly waterproof and keep your feet so warm. They are true to size and don’t rub your toes or irritate your feet like other boots I purchased. The bottom of the boots are non-slip as I had to walk up and down hills covered in snow and ice. They are very lightweight and and don’t look bulky on your feet. I will definitely purchase another pair for personal use.

UPDATE: These boots are not waterproof at all. If too much water gets on them the inside of your boots will be soaked. I work outside so I’m pissed about the false advertising of waterproof material. Several times I’ve worn these my socks and the inside of the boots would be soaked from walking through the snow."
Bad design cause blister when you flex your feet.,8.5 Wide,Gray-cam,1.0,"I’m so disappointed! When this boot arrived I really like it, but after one week I'm left with disappointment and regret.
The boot has a faulty design that makes the hard lower part dig into your ankle. Especially if you drive a lot, as your feet is in the position of pressing the accelerator, the hard last part digs into your ankle and causes a painful blister. You can see it in the video, as you flex your feet the soft part bends and the hard part digs. I tried to use two socks to see if it would protect me from this but no use. If you don’t drive at all and only use this to walk around it may work. Anyway, I wouldn’t recommend it."
Worst boots ever!,9 Wide,Black2,1.0,"These are the most uncomfortable winter boots I’ve ever attempted to wear. They’re hard like ski boots on the sides and hurt, even if they “fit”. As far as fit, i ordered a Wide even tho I have a regular sized foot. I like to wear thick socks due to the winter temps where I live. There’s nothing “wide” about it except their imaginations. I compared to all my regular shoes, not boots, and they’re even more narrow than my shoes! I’m sorely disappointed. I was so excited to receive these as I’m disabled and have next to no funds. I saved up 2 years to buy boots!! I thought I could trust the description. Nope."
Awful! Not waterproof.,9,Black2,1.0,"These boots are cheap and awful! At first I loved them because they were extremely comfortable. After wearing them for a week straight, the comfort is now gone by 50%. My feet are wet and cold. I can’t figure out where water is coming in at. I tried these boots a couple of times during winter but each time my feet were wet- mainly down by my toes. I’m not talking about just a little wet, as in half my sock was wet. I tossed these in the trash and will never buy them again. Waste of money."
Lining was ripped upon arrival,6,Black2,1.0,The product came and the lining was ripped on the inside ankle area of one boot. I tried to return but the replacement was not going to arrive in time. I sewed it on my own and managed for my ski trip but I am very disappointed in the quality of these boots for as much as I paid. I do not recommend these unless you will have time for a return/replacement.
Color is way off!!,8.5,Brown,1.0,"These boots are very stiff and uncomfortable. I ordered beige and they are a pale pink. Unfortunately , due to having covid, I missed the return date. I would not recommend purchasing.I have no idea if they are waterproof as I never went out in rain. Donating to a homeless veterns organization ."
Not alot of foot support,10,White3,1.0,"I was not a fan of these, I felt like I was going to lose my balance. They had no foot support, I wasn't able to walk more than a few feet before I had to remove them."
Not warm enough,10.5,White3,1.0,I wear a 10.5 and have narrow feet. All manufacturers assume the longer feet are wider feet so at 10.5 I can wear many socks. My issue is with one pair of socks standing on a tarred driveway at about 34 degrees my feet were freezing.
Do better,7,Black1,1.0,"I bought these after reading reviews.... but I didn't have the same luck I guess, I work for a parcel delivery service and my feet are cold after about an hr and soaked within 2 hrs I'm very disappointed for what they cost they should definitely do better."
Is NOT waterproof,8.5 Wide,Gray-cam,1.0,Bought these boots for a 10 day trip to Canada. They are not waterproof like they claim. My feet were waterlogged after walking in the snow.
So I love them but falling apart on the side there’s a hole,8 Wide,White3,1.0,Very mad I wear them every and there’s a hold on the side of the boot and they slip still on snow . But they are good boot but falling apart on the side
Returned it,7,Black1,1.0,I returned it. It wasn’t what I expected.
Boots winter,9.5,Black2,1.0,The boots are nice they are very roomy so if you wear a 9 go with a 9 pleased with them
I need a right footed boot,6,Black3,1.0,Can’t wear two left boots
Garbage!!!,8.5 Wide,Black2,1.0,I've had these boots for 1 months. Seems inside came apart and my feet became soaking wet in sub zero temps!!!!! Do not buy!!!!
Cold,8 Wide,Brown,1.0,Used in the snow my feet froze after 10 minutes not waterproof at all my sock got so wet had to take them off.
NOT WATERPROOF!,10.5,Gray-cam,1.0,Unfortunately these are not waterproof so beware!
"I was sent dirty, used boots.",8 Wide,White2,1.0,"I was sent dirty, used boots."
Not waterproof,6.5,Black1,1.0,"Got boots for my Christmas trip to Bend,. Not waterproof, toes freezing. Will return. Not happy."
Return 2 times,8.5,Brown,1.0,"For my first pair of boots, I order sizes up to and still small the second I order 2 sizes up to and still small. I just give up."
They’re not waterproof,9.5,Black-cam,1.0,"They’re absolutely not waterproof at all, the water soaked right through them, not even good enough for the snow, and they’re too small, my Wife wears an 8.5 and I got her a pair of 9’s"
Very uncomfortable. Wish I hadn't wasted the $,7,Brown,1.0,Very uncomfortable
Thay have leaked the first time thay got wet and still get my feet wet,10.5,Black1,1.0,Thay are not water proof
The boots were supposed to be wide but were not as wide as my work boots which are medium width.,8.5 Wide,Black1,1.0,I disliked the poor sizing
Not waterproof.,8,White3,1.0,The toes of these shoes got wet on the inside after I wore them once on my ski trip. I specifically ordered waterproof boots for this reason so very disappointed.
Looks like boats,10.5,Brown,1.0,"If you have bigger feet as I do, these will only make them appear bigger. IJS. To each his own..."
Need to return the boots,9.5,White3,1.0,"Didn't fit right and they were hard to get on my feet, so I gave up without putting them on completely. I want to return these boots."
Nada,8.5 Wide,Black1,1.0,Mala calidad
Returned not true to size,8.5,White-1,1.0,Beautiful and look well constructed but was unable to wear due to size. Very large!
Don't Last Long,9.5,Gray-cam,1.0,I bought these for my wife and they ripped in just over a month. DO NOT BUY
Coming apart and leaking already.,8.5,Black-cam,1.0,Held together w glue. Already leaking. Do not waste your money.
To heavy,9.5,Black2,1.0,These boots look good but they are to heavy on your feet
Very Clunky,8,White2,1.0,"Thes boots are adorable but very stiff, felt like I couldn’t walk in them at all, clunky."
Disappointed,10,Brown,1.0,"I dislike the boots, had to return them..they were huge..very huge..not its true size"
Very cheap looking,,,1.0,Very cheap looking
Think baby shoe soft,7,White-1,1.0,Not a really sturdy shoe. Filmsy. Waste of money!
They always felt like the sole was coming off.,10,Black1,1.0,You get what you pay for.
Don’t waste your time on these cheap quality boots!,8.5,Black2,1.0,"Don’t waste time or money on these, you can find better for the price. Cheap materials, not waterproof and incredibly stiff."
Not waterproof,6.5,Black3,1.0,Awful product boots are not waterproof. I wore them today in the snow and my feet were completely wet
Only if your feet are always cold.,10.5,White-0,1.0,Way too hot
So uncomfortable!,9 Wide,Black1,1.0,"I bought these boots because they are supposed to be wide, I wore them on the first snowfall for a few hours and had so much pain in my feet! Of course it was too late to return them, so I'm stuck with them, but I will never wear them again. So unhappy!!!"
NOT FOR COLD WEATHER,6,White3,1.0,"I bought these as these are labeled as WINTER WATERPROOF HIKING BOOTS
I delivered for Amazon and it was -3° outside. I even put hot hands in my boots and my feet would not stay warm. I wore 2 pairs of socks. 1 of them being thick wool. My feet felt burned from being so cold. You'd think for winter boots, they'd serve to keep your feet warm in the winter. Not happy with this purchase whatsoever. Only good thing about them is the traction on the sole."
Insanely slippery,6.5,Black2,1.0,I was so extremely happy when these arrived. They were soft and flexible and fit my feet really well but once I put them on my feet I began sliding all around my kitchen floor. Something on the bottoms were making the floor slick. I cannot imagine trying to wear these on ice. Also one of the shoes had clearly been worn before as the bottom was scuffed. :/ super unimpressed.
Not what I expected,8.5,White3,1.0,Cheap junk that smelled really bad.
Very uncomfortable,9,White3,1.0,Very uncomfortable
Doesn't grips,,,1.0,Doesn't grip tightly enough will not buy again.
Defective and smelly,7.5,Black3,1.0,It’s defective as one shoe was bigger than the other. Moreover the shoes had a stinking smell.
Bad product,7,Black3,1.0,It's a bad productos to small for the description. The quality it's real bad not recommend.waste your money in this

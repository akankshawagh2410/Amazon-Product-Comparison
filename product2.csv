Best snow and rain boots,7.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,I've gone too long without boots and decided to try these. They are so comfortable and looks great with everything. I read other reviews and was glad I did as I'm always a 7 but did size up to a 7.5 and they fit perfect. Size up half a size. I do have narrow and flat feet fyi. But the toe box narrows so if you don't size up then you will end up exchanging.
Cute!,8,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"Love the look of these shoes. I had been keeping my eye on them for a long time and snagged them on sale for Black Friday. They do not have a lot of cushion which kind of surprised me. I have to wear tall, thicker socks for them to be comfortable enough. I would buy them again as I really think they are cute. Just something to consider if the cushion is an issue for you."
Love them BUT,9,"Taffy, Black",4.0,"So don’t get me wrong. I love them. Wear them every single day in the fall/winter/spring. Waterproof. I let the laces loose so I can just slip them on and run out the door with my boys. HOWEVER, I am disappointed with the lack of “squish” on the inside. Like there’s noooo support really at all. So when you’re standing at a kids game they can get a little uncomfy just bc of the lack of support. I guess I could add insoles but for the price tag I’d expect a little love for my piggies. Also I have never found an insole I actually find comfy so there that. Still love them though. I wear them out gardening in march and literally every single day when it’s raining or snowing and they’ve held up awesome. I’ll for sure buy them again. My critique is harsh and if I’m being nit picky."
So comfortable!,5.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",5.0,I love these boots. I put them on the first time and wore them all day. They are true to size. I usually wear a 5 in most shoes but I typically go up to a 5.5 for boots to leave room for thicker socks and 5.5 fit me perfectly. Love the color and the match with everything to.
SO cute and perfect for winter days!,10,"Stone Green, Black",5.0,"I first spotted these boots at a major retail store, but unfortunately, they didn't have my size. Turning to Amazon proved to be a stroke of luck, as not only did I find the perfect fit, but they also came at a slightly lower price. However, I must express a bit of disappointment regarding the lack of cushioning on the inside. The absence of substantial support can make them uncomfortable during extended periods. Overall, these boots have exceeded my expectations and are undoubtedly worth every penny."
Love the look of these,7,"Fawn, Sea Salt",5.0,"I liked these so much I bought them in grey too! Be advised the grey ones are kinda sparkly which I wasn’t expecting. See pic

I originally saw these at a big box store but they didn't have my size, so I turned to Amazon and even better they were a little less in price. I bought these primarily for a trip to England, we will be going in their rainy season and wanted something stylish, comfortable, and light weight not in that particular order. These I feel were definitely worth the price. I have walked numerous times around the block trying to go a long distance to make sure they will hold up on the streets of London and I think they will definitely deliver. They come in a variety of colors and paired with some thicker socks I hope they will be perfect."
They're as cute as they look!,7,"Dove, Sea Sprite",5.0,"I love everything Sorel makes. These are no exception- but order up a 1/2 size if you want to be comfortable. I wear a 6.5 in their wedge sandals, and a 7 in anything with an enclosed toe, or boot. These boots are light weight, easy to take on an off, and feel nice. So far I've only tested them in the coldest temps so far this year (about 20 degrees) and my feet weren't cold. I probably wouldn't reach for them if it's below 0 due to the gap around the ankles."
"The boot is very nice, although they defiantly need real good breaking in which I cannot",8.5,"Vintage Pink, Gum 16",4.0,"I’ve purchased Mandy sorel boots, all of which were comfy when you first slipped your foot into them , these were not like those."
Love love love!,10.5,"Vintage Pink, Gum 16",5.0,These babies are so cute! I love them they’re very comfortable. I can string them loose so I can slip them off and on. They work great for low snow days.
Comfy and Cute,8.5,"Black, Sea Salt",5.0,"Waterproof and fit over my cankles comfortably! Make sure you order a half size up as others have suggested.
Wore them all day today with no blisters or rubs. Still comfortable!"
Comfortable,9,"Taffy, Black",5.0,They are the most comfortable and warm short boot. They are fashionable. I have had numerous people comment on them asking where I got them. Very well made. Worth the money
This is a Christmas gift,7,"Taffy, Black",4.0,They look great. I hope they fit the person I'm giving them to.
My new favorite shoe,9.5,"Taffy, Black",5.0,"These shoes are awesome! I am a hair stylist and on the very first day I got them, I wore them ALL day and my feet didn't hurt at all. They are so comfortable and so cute."
Great Looking Boot,6.5,"Black, Grill",5.0,I bought these boots because they are waterproof. As soon as I put them on I knew they would be perfect. I bought a 1/2 size up. They are easy to get on and off. They are super comfortable. I am very pleased with my purchase.
Cute shoes wish I was younger,8.5,"White, Cyber Yellow",5.0,The fabric is nylon which is different then the other shoes. They were too bright white for me to pull off but cute. I wish I lived them. I bought another color.
True to size maybe a little to much tongue 👅,8,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"Comfortable. True to size. Great color goes great with leggings. The tonge gets a little bunched up when tying tight. Once worn more it’ll probably soften up and lay flatter.
If we ever get snow maybe I’ll get another color:)"
Christmas Gift,8.5,"Taffy, Black",5.0,The boots are a Christmas gift for my granddaughter! I’m sure she’ll love them!!
So comfortable!,7,"Sea Salt, Black",5.0,"This is my second pair of shoes from Sorel and I am obsessed! These are super comfy, so cute, and keep your feet warm and dry. Fit true to size."
In & Out Boot,10,"Dove, Sea Sprite",5.0,"Gift for my daughter. Going to give wsva Christmas gift. They run small. Usually wears size 9. Bought 9 1/2. Toe hit front of boot. Reordered size 10. They fit perfectly!
Bought for a teacher who travels between schools throughout the day and does not have the time or convenience to change boots/shoes at each school. These are perfect for outside and inside for Wisconsin winters."
So cute!,9,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,These are adorable! I would go a half size up. I wear an 8.5 but ordered a 9 and they are great! Stylish and keep my feet dry/warm.
With winter boots always buy brand name,10,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"Everything about this waterproof boot is top notch. The style is trendy, the way it’s made, all pros."
Meoooww,NA,NA,5.0,"These are good looking boots, super comfortable, love the features (waterproof). My only downside is the stitching hits my right great toe bunion, which hurts, but isn’t the shoe’s fault."
"Comfortable, Cute and Warm",7,"Omega Taupe, Black",5.0,"I love these! I bought them for a trip to the mountains. They were warm, durable and the fact that they are waterproof was very helpful."
Great multi-purpose shoe. Love them!,7,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"This boot is a great cross over shoe. It works at the dog park and in the snow. It is stylish and comfortable yet keeps my feet war, and dry. In the often-crowded field of winter footwear, Sorel's Out 'N About III Classic Boot for women makes an indelible mark, blending quintessential craftsmanship with innovative design. Consider this the Tesla of winter boots, if you will—engineering and style coexisting in perfect harmony.
Ergonomically designed, the boot seems to whisper, ""Go ahead, conquer that mountain—or at least that snowy parking lot."" The archsupport could be likened to a business mentor: always there to guide you, adding confidence in each step. The traction is remarkable, an excellent safety feature that could be equated to a market risk assessment in its ability to mitigate slip-ups."
Perfect,8.5,"Stone Green, Black",5.0,"Cute dress up or dressed down. Super functional. I live in Wisconsin and wear them pretty much every day all fall, winter, and spring. They keep you warm and dry without overheating your feet."
Great boots!,8,"Dove, Sea Sprite",4.0,"Super comfy and cute! Love that I can slip them off and on. Warm enough when it's not crazy cold, otherwise I recommend wearing wool socks with these boots and then it's perfect!"
Love them,9.5,"Stone Green, Black",5.0,These boots are so comfortable and warm. I’m obsessed with them. Looking into another style already. Worth the penny.
Super cute!!,7.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"I love how cute these boots are! They don't have a ton of arch support or cushion but nothing that insoles can't fix. They aren't uncomfortable by any means. I have narrow high arched feet. I usually wear a 7.5 so I ordered a 7.5 and 8. The 8 fit better. The 7.5 wasn't super tight but too close to my great toe. I love these boots because they are so cute! I just got them today so, so far I recommend. If I experience any issues, I'll update my review."
"Super cute , size up 1/2",8,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,I ended up sizing up a 1/2 size. Very comfortable
Easy to get on and off. Loo great. Comfortable and well built.,7,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,Comfortable and easy to get on and off. Really pretty. Very well built.
Sorel brand fave,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,Great weather proof boots that look really cute!
Must Buy!,10,"Taffy, Black",5.0,"So cute, stylish, and comfortable! They look great on and make my feet look smaller than they are. As with all of my Sorels, I suggest going a half size up."
Warm,7.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",5.0,"I got to do the try me with these shoes, they are absolutely perfect!!! The temperature where I live has been below 30 degrees and these shoes have kept my feet nice and warm and extremely comfortable!! I also walked through some snow and my feet reminds nice and dry."
Sorel’s,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,Super cute and waterproof:) can’t wait for winter now.
"Love, love, love",7.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",5.0,I love these boots they’re waterproof. I get compliments on them all the time highly recommend.
So cute and comfortable!,9,"Taffy, Black",5.0,So cute and super comfortable! You can dress them up or down and they go with everything!
Great shoes!!,9,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"I waited a while to get these and now I don’t know why! I love them! Super comfy work well in all types of weather! Great fit as expected, great material! Would buy again."
Warm,9.5,"Stone Green, Black",5.0,Perfect fit and looks great
"Love the look of these boots, but sole separated",7.5,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"These were some of my favorite boots; the style and fit are superb! Unfortunately, the rubber soles started to peel away from the boot in the back of both."
Price is for the look and name brand,10,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"I tried these shoes on in a store where I decided that they were roomy enough to go down a half size. After I received mine from this listing, I was surprised they were too small. I'm also a little annoyed that the tongue of the shoe is a bit small. They don't lay flat, and is shorter than the top of the shoe. I definitely recommend insoles as well."
water proof,7.5,"Vintage Pink, Gum 16",5.0,"I like walking during the rainy day but my feet always got wet. As soon as I got these shoese, I tried to walk my neighbor but I didn't get wet at all. They are a little bit heavier than I thought but still good."
Awesome Boots!,7.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,I love these boots! I wore them to an outdoor event over the weekend and it was rainy. These boots don’t even look like I wore them. Amazing!
Love these!,NA,NA,5.0,Warm and Cozy.
Sizing is weird,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,I order an 8.5 (normal size) but they felt a little small so I ordered a 9 and they are way to big. However that are so freaking cute!
"Run small, otherwise love",NA,NA,4.0,"Normally wear 9.5 or 10. I’ve tried these in 10 and 10.5, should have ordered 11.
Otherwise very comfortable, love the style."
Hard boots and fit is not right,5.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",3.0,"The sole is nice and thick, but it doesn’t fit me as well as I was hoping. Despite how the shoes appear, they actually don’t bend much at all. These are hard boots. Also, the toe is upturned too much. Maybe it’d fit better if I had a half size larger."
Runs small,8,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,ORDER UP A FULL SIZE. Not true to size. I wear a 7.5 and ordered up a half size (8) to accommodate thick socks. These fit like a 7.
Cute but…,8,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"I think these boots are so cute! Once they arrived, I was pretty disappointed with the comfort they DONT provide. They feel stiff, they dont offer support and there is very little cushioning in the insole. That said, if you are looking for boots to wear casually and not for a lot of walking they are very cute. For short distances, they are fine, I just wouldn’t want to be stuck in these if I had a big walk ahead of me!"
Comfortable,8,"Canoe, Light Bisque",5.0,Love these. True to size and comfortable
Mostly alright,9.5,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"Runs small, a little narrow in the toe box."
AMAZING!!!,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"I actually bought these shoes because I was going on a cruise to Alaska and had planned on doing a lot of walking. THEY ARE TRULY AMAZING! They saw all of Skagway, all of Juneau, all of Icy Straight Point and I had no issues whatsoever. They are super cute and very stylish."
Comfy & Cute,NA,NA,5.0,Love these waterproof boots that are so comfy and cute! Lots of warmth.
Well made! Comfortable,9,"Taffy, Black",5.0,These are very durable!
Runs short,9.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",3.0,"Love these boots, but they run short. Ordered my regular size but my toe hits the front of the boot. Returning and ordering the next size up"
"Cute, but not comfortable",12,"Taffy, Black",3.0,"These are a cute style. Make your feet look small. The toes are very stiff. Not very comfortable. Slip on, and feel loose… no padding. I took the advice of other reviews and sized up, but I would not recommend. True to size."
Not the same,10.5,"Black, Grill",3.0,These fit however there’s not much cushioning on the bottom and the sides of the boot rub against my inner ankle. These two things combined only makes these ideal for running quick errands.
Little super boots,7.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"First off I love Sorel boots generally… I have their original Joan of Arcs and two pairs of their suede ankle boots. I bought these for a trip I’m taking in spring to Japan where there will be snow/ lots of walking. In an effort to break them in I took them on a ski trip to Mammoth and figured they’d keep me warm in the car bc I’m always cold.
They are sooo warm and soo lightweight… like running shoes light weight. They do run a tad small so I went up a half size. I suggest wearing with socks that cover your ankle as they can rub a bit like high tops. As for waterproof… they are AMAZING. I literally got out of the car in slushy snow that went nearly to the top… no water went inside and the inside stayed really dry. The outside dries relatively fast and they don’t show dirt easily/clean up easily. They have a nice removable/washable sole. You can lace them tight or loose if you want more of an Ugg boot pull on/off feel. They are super walkable. I only gave 4 stars for support because they are not as supportive as other boots."
too small! size up!!,7,"Omega Taupe, Black",3.0,"I'm going to have go return these, my toes are scrunched at the top. I'm a true 7 with narrow feet, and would probabley need an 8 in these. the reviews on comfort were 50/50, seems like they might be pretty comfortable if I got a pair that fit. I don't know yet if I will trade or just return. They are cute though!"
Run small,8.5,"Dove, Sea Sprite",4.0,The shape of the toe box kind of smashed my toes. I exchanged for a larger size than normal and they fit better.
Lovely,9,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"Fit great, good traction"
Comfortable and Stylish,9,"Taffy, Black",4.0,"I bought this boot because I love the style and am a fan of the brand. While comfortable, it does not seem like the type of boot you want to go hiking in as the sole doesn’t have enough traction."
"So cute, but so not comfy",8,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"I love these boots so much for the look and style, but if you're looking for comfort I don't recommend buying these. The tongue is rigid and stiff which pokes into my foot, even with thick wool socks on. Bummer!"
Wearing out after 1 year,7.5,"Black, Grill",4.0,"I bought these boots January 2022 & I'm looking to replace them by January 2023. Let me start by saying I do like these boots.

But the seam is splitting on the top at the rubber/leather seam. Some of the rubber is cracking as well. I've worn them for winter weather walking in the city through snow and rain.

YES they keep my feet dry, but not warm and if tied too tightly the top of my foot has bruised.
I do like the style and I think they would keep well if you don't plan to do a lot of walking but want dry feet and a stylish boot."
Awesome sneakers,6.5,"White, Cyber Yellow",5.0,Super comfortable great quality. I ordered half size up and fits perfectly
It's a good winter boot and spring because they are water proof!,9.5,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"They are comfortable. They do run small like some other people were saying in the reviews. I had to exchange them for a 1/# size bigger and really should have did a whole size up because I wear thick wool socks. I also did have an issue with 1 tongue on my left boot. It started coming apart at the right corner by the lace hole. I have to push it down so it comfortable when I pull the strings tight to tie my shoe,not that big of a deal but for the price that shouldn't happen. They are waterproof,me and my dogs walked in the rain,snow an spasmed on my cars! My feet stay warm mostly if the temp is about 25° and up with sun even with wool socks,not too bad! I am starting,after a lil over 3 mths of wearing and having them that water is getting in to my boots somehow at the bottom or sides of them,feet getting wet,not cool! Warranty just bite the dust Jan 31 so I gotta eat the price and have wet feet. It was good while it lasted! Would recommend!"
"Super cute, not super comfortable",8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"Love the look of them, but they weren’t very comfortable (especially around the ankle)."
Great throw on boot for running around,8.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",4.0,These boots come just above the ankle. They are waterproof so no rain spots. They are comfortable. While there is no fluffiness inside the boot there is thin fabric and it does keep your feet warm. I have worn them in spring and cold weather and with warm socks in the winter they keep your feet toasty. These are good for rain days for sure or just to throw on and run around in on average day. I have not worn them in snow yet but have in cold weather. I walked a few miles at a time in them with no discomfort at all. The sole keeps a nice distant between you and the cement so you can’t feel the cold of the cement. Great product. I took one star off because mine had a small stain on it right out of the box. My photos are after wearing the boots several times. I wear a size 8 and got an 8.5 because I wanted room for thicker socks. They are perfect however I believe an 8 may have worked as well but am happy with my 8.5. If I bought again I’d stick with the 8.5. Hope this helps.
Great boots,9,"Omega Taupe, Black",5.0,"Really nice winter boots, stylish and comfortable"
great for when it rains,9.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",4.0,"I needed a replacement because the rubber stripe that goes around the bottom edge was
separating AND water was starting leaking in. I have the other boots ready to return."
no support but cute,7.5,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"update - 3 months in and these are tearing apart at the sole! for the price, i definitely expected better quality. i rarely wear these more than to and from work (change shoes once i get there) so for them to be doing this already is nuts.

had to go up half a size and there is zero support in these. I'll have to get some insoles for them. I walked a lot in them the past couple days and it was not comfortable."
"Love the style, not as comfortable as I’d hoped.",9,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,This boot was meant to go with me to Switzerland to walk around the cities and get me up the Alps. I was looking for a sneaker like boot. Something stylish and comfortable. While cute this wasn’t very comfortable or provide much support. It will be left home but I will wear on rainy or snowy day here.
Cute But Not Comfortable,9,"Taffy, Black",2.0,"Very cute boots, seem to repel water from the small amount of rain they were worn it but were VERY uncomfortable. Very flat boot, little support, little cushioning, foot slides forward every so slightly causing toes to be pressed together and hurt. Even tried pulling their insole and using a Dr Scholls to add more support and padding and they still were not comfortable in the toe box. Also tried sizing down a half size from my regular Sorel size and still a no go. Disappointing coming from this brand. I got the regular shoe version as well and same thing. So both will now be a maybe wear to the office on a wet/snowy day, something where I am not moving around at all. Not ideal for the cost. These could be amazing if they'd put some effort into comfort and support as well as aesthetics."
There’s something wrong with the tongue of the shoe,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,"I’m not the first reviewer to say this. I love these shoes - they are stinking cute but the lining of the suede tongue sticks out around the laces and you. Ant tuck it back in - it’s almost like it isn’t wide enough or something. Unless Amazon shipped me the defective one that other reviewers mention, I’d pass on this."
Comfortable but…,10.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",4.0,These boots fit better than most other Sorels I have tried. They are comfortable and warm. The only negative thing I can say about them is where the tongue is stitched to the shoe the seam is a bit bulky and does rub on the top of my foot. I did find that with a little adjustment when putting it on it can avoided
Good but not perfect,9.5,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,The boots are waterproof which is great but they run a little small and cause a little irritation on the heels. They may just need to be broken in.
The tongue is funny,9,"Dove, Sea Sprite",4.0,Super cute! Took me a while to get them laced the way I wanted so that I could just pull them on. The area where the tongue attaches seems to be poorly designed or maybe it’s just my pair. The gray fabric part takes on a blue tint when outdoors. They are so lightweight and roomy without being floppy or rubbing my heels or ankles.
Daughter Loves this Gift,7.5,"Dove, Sea Sprite",5.0,And she can't wait to wear them on the mother/daughters trip to Ireland
Very uncomfortable!,11,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"These were referred to me by a friend who has a slightly older version and they are horrible! Like someone else mentioned the tongue does not sit right and rubs against the top of your foot. For this much money why are these not a dream? The style is beautiful and they are so nice to look at, but for this much money they better be comfortable! How disappointing. This is my 3rd pair of Sorel I returned in a week. I bought Eddie Bauers instead and they were like wearing a cloud. So much cheaper and SO much more comfortable! Also, I typically wear an 11 in boots, but these were really big. I could've sized down at least a 1/2 size, possibly more. My regular shoe size is a 10 though."
Awesome boot,9,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"I love these! I had waiting quite some time to buy them, as they are expensive, but now I am so glad that I did. They are waterproof and keep my feet warm. They are cute too. I mainly use them while hiking or walking my dogs where sometimes I have to walk through mud, puddles, or wet grass. I recently went to Oregon and used them on the beach, and they were great for that too on a cool rainy day. I have not used them in the snow, but I think that for short treks in snow, they would be good enough. Update: I've had these boots just a bit over a year and they are holding up well. I have worn them often and have not regretted my purchase a bit. An added benefit is that they do keep my feet warm, as well as dry, on my early morning walks."
I expected more,8,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"I had high hopes for these since they are Sorel's and cost more than other comparable boots. I received them the day before we received 9"" of snow. I usually wear a 7 1/2 in shoes so ordered the 8 since most of the reviews stated they ran small. They were too big even with thick socks. I pulled a set of insoles out of an old pair of tennis shoes and that helped. It also added some cushion since the insoles that came with the boots had ZERO. There is also no insulation so my feet got cold in the snow. I don't think they're rated as ""winter boots"" so I didn't mark them down on that. The reviews about the extra material on the tongue pressing into the top of the foot were spot on. It is uncomfortable but am hopeful it softens up after more wear. I might just cut that little triangle of material out. I was also disappointed there was no cushioning around the ankle. Since we were getting all the snow and I had no other alternative to wear to walk the dog, I kept them. They are waterproof so that is good. If we weren't going to have the snow, I would've returned them. They will work for what I want them for (walking the dog in the rain) but was hoping for something better for the brand name and price."
Nice boots!,8.5,"Taffy, Black",5.0,"I got the 9 as 8 1/2 seemed just a bit small. So comfortable, wore them on a little 5 mile walk/hike right away and they were great. I love them and wear them all the time. I would but again and highly recommend."
Super cute!,9,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"I debated for the longest time whether or not to get 8.5 or 9 being I’m in between the two. I went off reviews and ordered bigger and got the 9... I’ll be returning for the 8.5. Hoping they break in good, they feel pretty rigid right now. Overall though, super cute & can’t wait to wear them!"
So uncomfortable,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,"I’m usually a Sorel fan and these are super cute but really uncomfortable which was surprising. The tongue is too short so the laces are up against your ankle and the tops are stiff, which I didn’t expect. Because of the short tongue, I don’t see how your foot would stay dry or warm. I’ll use these for short walks with the dog around the neighborhood, no long walks, no hikes."
A nice slip-on everyday winter boot,9,"Omega Taupe, Black",4.0,I really like the way these look! I do have to wear thicker socks for them to feel really comfortable. I’ve got them tied perfectly so I just slip them on and off. Good in the snow and rain. I’m happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend.
Perfect,11,"Dove, Sea Sprite",5.0,Nice to find a winter boot that looks good
Love em,10.5,"Taffy, Black",4.0,Love these boots. I got them after a pair of Bearpaws broke down in less than a month and am so happy I decided to splurge on these 🙌 love em
Comfortable and Stylish,10,"Omega Taupe, Black",4.0,"I ordered these for our trip to Ireland since it’s known to rain a bit. I needed shoes that were waterproof, comfortable for hiking, and stylish. I give them the higher rating for stylish and waterproof but I’m not sure how they will be on the long treks. While comfy they don’t seem to have great arch support. Four out of five on comfort. I did order a size up based on reviews and they fit perfectly."
Go Up ½-1 Size,NA,NA,5.0,"I just got them today, but even without socks they seem quite small to previous Sorels. For context I'm a US 9, but I've taken to buying US 9.5 so I don't have to break in shoes. Sorel's I've always had to go up half a size, but I took one look at the rubber and decided to go for a US 10 (which happens a lot on boots for me, so still a norm) and I'm glad I did! I'll try to update my review, but on cursory glance, best go up ½ or 1 size.

Update 1 Sep 2022: I would definitely start a full size up on these shoes. During winter with thick socks these feel small if I'm on my feet all day. They've held up well & for Seattle they're a great shoe for daily wear (with insoles), but because of the rubber, you can't break them in ever. It's good. They do exactly what they're supposed to do, get them!"
Not comfortable,9,"Stone Green, Black",2.0,"I know lots of people love these boots. I did not find them comfortable. They hurt my feet after wearing them for a day. Also, they run small. I would size up one size."
Style is so cute! Glad I went a half size up! Came with a couple marks.,7,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,I love the look of these! I tried them on with thick fuzzy socks and fit just right! The only thing I would say is for the money spent they should come without what looks like a white paint drop on one of the toes. And has a weird small “stain” on the front of the tan fabric. Other than that I love them!
Very comfortable and warm,7.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"Love love love these shoes. Purchased to have warm and waterproof boots practical enough for daily wear if needed. These are perfect!! These shoes are very comfortable, easy to get on, cute, keep my feet warm and dry. True to size. I typically wear 7.5 or 8. I purchased a 7.5 and they fit great even with a thicker sock. I will be ordering other colors!"
My new favorite boots!,8.5,"Taffy, Black",5.0,"I’ve lived my whole life in So Cal and never put much thought into buying waterproof boots, let alone ones that I can walk in all day.

Well I saw these in real life and thought they were really cute and decided to look them up. After being talked out of buying several pair I settled on the tan and black ones. It ended up raining a few days after I bought these so I saw that as the perfect opportunity to take these on a test drive.

After about a full day of wear I love that they have a little bit of a heel (not much), they are beyond comfortable to walk around in, and they are very much waterproof. I’m a women’s 8.5 and I can wear medium to thick socks and they still feel comfortable."
Quality. Style. Comfort.,NA,NA,3.0,The pull on tab is broken.
Best waterproof boots!,7,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"The boots are extremely comfortable. I use a hard plastic insole inside for arch support but even without the insoles, the boots are still very comfortable. I was skeptical about the felt fabric being waterproof but I was quickly proven wrong. The whole shoe is waterproof and help up great so far in pouring rain. The colors are beautiful and compliment each other well. These boots go with practically everything. They are much lighter than my other waterproof hiking boots by LA Sportiva. I bought a size 7 and normally wear a size 7 shoe and it fits true to size. I have a little room for thicker socks but they are just as comfortable with thin socks too. Great shoe and I would definitely recommend! Shipping was also faster than anticipated."
Great boot,9,"Dove, Sea Sprite",5.0,"I really like these and that they are waterproof. They are comfortable but not a ton of support- I considered getting an insole. I live in a mild climate where its cool and rainy in winter so they are plenty warm for me. I did read a few reviews saying to size up. I normally wear an 8.5 and I bought a 9, and I think an 8.5 would've been better, but I didn't want to mess with a return/exchange. They work but there's more wiggle room than I really need."
Uncomfortable and unsupportive,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,Super cute just like the pictures! However the tongue of the shoes was sewn twisted on both shoes and they were very uncomfortable. It felt like it tilted my foot strangely to the side and was too wide with no arch support. Returned.
Good Buy!,8,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,LOVE the look of these boots! I have a wider foot but my normal size fit Great! They are warm on a cold Midwest day with my wool socks. I will have to wait to see how well they hold up during my upcoming Alaska trip! I bought 2 pair to see which color I liked best- now I want BOTH pairs!!!!
"Large, slips off easy",9,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"It is taking me a long time to get used to these, I want to love them because they are so darn cute. They fit very wide and large, if you don’t wear thick socks they tend to slip as you walk. They’re not super comfortable either.."
Soles separated,7,"Dove, Sea Sprite",2.0,I only wore a few times and the soles started to separate already.
Little slim for wide feet. Very warm!,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"Wore them to a trip to New York City over Christmas. Miles of walking each day and the only complaint I have is that if I wore two layers of socks, then one shoe fell a little snuggle for my pinky toe. They actually were warm enough to only wear one layer of thick socks. It rained almost the whole time and I never felt wet at all! I truly love these!"
Comfy & cute,8,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,I bought these boots for an upcoming mountain trip and I’m in love with them!!! So cute and very comfortable and waterproof!
Mostly do the job,5.5,"Stone Green, Black",3.0,"I’d size up as they run tight. They do the job because they work as a waterproof winter boot in the snow without being bulky. I like the look too. However, they’re not the most comfortable boot. I replaced the inserts with some that provided some arch support and that’s helped a bit."
Sorel boots,9,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"The quality is excellent. I think I should’ve went up a half size. Sometimes my feet swell. But, they are nice."
Runs small,11,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,Luv luv BUT runs small. I bought my size 11 but needed the 12. Maybe that is why they make a size 12 because they know the 11 is not long enough.
Boot size,NA,NA,2.0,The boots I ordered ran very small. I could barely get my feet into them.
Not very comfortable or warm,6,"Omega Taupe, Black",2.0,They don't make them like they used to. Very little insulation and not very comfortable. They look good but that's all. Very disappointed.
Disappointed,9,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,I've only had mine for about 60 days and the rubber sole is separating
Very uncomfortable,10.5,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,Product looked worn and creases thruout the boot tounge. Looked very defective. Sending back.
Fell apart after 15 wears,7,"Taffy, Black",1.0,Paid $200....falling apart after about 15 wears
Sole is detaching after 4 wears.,NA,NA,1.0,"The bootie is so cute and comfortable! I got a lot of compliments the couple times I wore them out shopping. I’ve only worn them 4 times… the sole is detaching from the shoe. I don’t know if I got a bad pair or what, but these would never withstand doing real work. Reaching out to seller. If reimbursed or replaced with a shoe that doesn’t fall apart I’ll change my review. These shoes are too expensive to fall apart."
Run small,6,"Fawn, Sea Salt",2.0,I always wear a 6 and these wear about a 1/2 to whole size too small
Broken shoe lace strap,NA,NA,1.0,"I honestly loved these but after wearing them ONE time in non-rain/snow weather, the shoe lace strap broke off. So disappointed. Just returned."
Perfect for everyday wear,10,"Omega Taupe, Black",5.0,I love these boots. They are super comfortable so you can wear them all day. They’re lightweight like tennis shoes but will keep your feet warm. My feet always run cold and these are perfect for winter weather. True to size.
Uncomfortable and not durable,NA,NA,1.0,"I kept thinking that I could “break” them in and they wouldn’t hurt to walk or stand in, that never happened. Also…within 2 months time of limited wear, the sole started to peel away on the toe. These were too expensive for the product that I received."
Uncomfortable and not warm,7,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,"I was so.bummed when I were these on a cold day to learn how uncomfortable and cold these were. The price is only for the logo, not quality craftsmanship."
Run a little small I'd size up 1/2 size,7,"Omega Taupe, Black",5.0,I'm so bummed I ordered 7 they are so cute but alittle small ..no 7.5 avaliable
Super uncomfortable!,NA,NA,1.0,"These boots are REALLY uncomfortable! No cushioning inside and super stiff. Hard to get off and on. Would NOT recommend, and now I’m stuck with them because the return window is really short"
Very uncomfortable to wear.,10,"Taffy, Black",1.0,These are not comfortable and hurt my feet. I was disappointed. This brand has always been comfortable.
Runs small,7.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",1.0,Too small
Terrible quality,9,"Black, Grill",1.0,I’ve only worn these about ten times since purchasing last spring. The rubber came away from the boot at the toes and let’s water in. I can’t believe how poor quality these were especially given the brand and price. They ran small which may have contributed but not so small my feet hurt. Can’t say if they are known offs or not. Return period is over and im max/sad
Not for daily wear,8.5,"Dove, Jet",3.0,I love my boots so much they are almost a daily wear for me. They are cute and comfortable. Im sad that about 9 months they started falling apart. For a pricy boot I didn't expect this. They are true Sorels and the rubber on my left to is peeling back. The seam by the insole on the right boot is also coming apart. I noticed recently that the rubber covering the toe is cracking. IF I get another pair they will not be daily wear… But that will be difficult for me.
Order half size up even if other Sorels fit in your usual size,8.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",4.0,"I was annoyed with myself for not listening to the other reviews. I wear a size 8 in every shoe brand, including Sorel (I own 3 other pairs of Sorels) so I was sure the other reviewers were wrong when they said to size up. They were right. Size 8 fit, but when walking, my big toe was jammed up into the front of the boot. I could probably make it work, but very uncomfortably, so I just re-ordered an 8.5 which I think will be perfect. This will be the only size 8.5 shoe I own, so listen to the other reviewers and order 1/2 size up."
Only lasted one season 😢,10,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,I loved these boots until they split open (see pic). They were comfortable and water proof. But I took them out to wear again this fall and they are split. Super disappointed since I spent $200 at REI to get them. Save your money and get something that will last longer than 1 winter.
Scammed,NA,NA,1.0,"I spent way too much money on sorel boots to have them split wide open.
I was cheated and scammed for my money"
Love them but cause stinky feet,NA,NA,2.0,"I love these, but they make me feet smell. I have tried several different types of socks, and same result. I have the black and wool ones, and those are fine. Not sure what’s up with them, but they look cute."
Sole became unglued after just a few dozen wearings,7.5,"Black, Grill",2.0,Otherwise I loved these little boots. Ran true to size.
Very uncomfortable,10.5,"Black, Sea Salt",1.0,I liked the style but they were extremely uncomfortable and no support or all. Make sure to get half size larger my toes touched the top of boot.
Nice,11,"White, Cyber Yellow",3.0,Just hurt my bunion . So it had to go!!
"Returned, but ordered a dofferemt size!",10,"Dove, Sea Sprite",5.0,"I ordered the wrong size! So often my feet are a liittle too big for the size I think I should order, but these are not. I have reordered the next 1/2 size smaller, can't wait for them to get here. They seem very well made, and exactly what I want. I have a pair of Sorels for heavy duty walking in snow, etc, these wil give me a nice option when there isn't quite so much snow."
These are so cute!,9,"Taffy, Black",5.0,"Play Video
 I live in New England, boots are required if you spend any time out side. You can tell yourself you don't need another pair or you just ask yourself do I have a cute functional pair? These are great out and about boots, no I would not wear these to shovel or expect them to be the warmest pair I own, but perfect for keeping my feet dry and not weighing 25 pounds a piece."
Nice boots,10,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"These are really well made boots, but a little “short”. Size 10 normally gives me plenty of room, but while these have a nice wide toe box, my toes touch the front of the boot."
So many compliments!,8,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"The name Out 'N About suits this boot perfectly!

I received so many compliments on these on a recent trip to Colorado.

I just ordered a pair of high top Sorel sneakers. I can't wait to get them!

I did give the support 4 stars BUT not because of the shoe. I have planters fasciitis so my so for me to give something a 5 in that area is almost impossible."
Best bid boots ever,8,"Omega Taupe, Black",5.0,"I LOVE these.

They are very waterproof. Could use some insole support if you have high arches and walk a lot. Not for mud or heavy hiking but they're perfect for grocery shopping and running errands in the winter. I wore them 5 days straight in mud and rain and after wiping them down they still look new. They go well with jeans and leggings. My favorite boots for winter casual"
"Awesome boots, runs large",8.5,"Taffy, Black",5.0,"Love these boots, they run large, eve. With heavy socks so I ordered an 8.5, my true shoe size, and there is plenty of room for thick socks. Very comfy, sturdy, water proof"
Not as narrow as other styles,9.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,I really like this lower boot! It’s comfortable and it is a little bit wider of a style than other Sorel boots. Plus it’s really cute
Comfortable and sturdy,11,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,These boots look great! They keep your feet warm! They are comfortable and sturdy enough to hike 6 miles up a mountain in. Love the looks and received so many compliments
Love sorels,8.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",5.0,Love these boots.. ordered a half size up for thick socks... These aren't lined so if you live in the tundra you will need some thick socks... That being said... Little tight around the ankle but toes have plenty of room and they will stretch out a little ... I love them... My plantar fasciitis isnt bothering me at all... Because there aren't anyy inserts in them either.... I tried some from my hey dude's shoes.... And they actually hurt... I know .. makes no sense at all .. but that's my story and I'm sticking to it .. good luck and get outside!!
Don’t delay!!,8,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"If you’re thinking of buying these shoes, don’t delay! Just do it. They are the most perfect casual/winter boot to have for the fall. Comfortable. Can wear with think or thin sock. I wear a size 8 and bought an 8. I do not have a wide or narrow foot, so the fit is perfect for me. They were expensive, which is why I hesitated, but now that I have them, I love them!! Worth the buy and great quality boot. Great with jeans, leggings, shorts and causal rompers."
"Cute and water proof, not warm.",9.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,These boots are super cute and keep my feet dry which is what I was aiming for. They are absolutely not warm for the toes. Not much insulation in the toe area. I sized up a half size which I was glad I did. They didn’t feel all that comfortable when I first put them on but have since gotten more comfortable. I like them but they are not a winter boot.
Solution for the tongue,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,I have skinny ankles. There was pressure on the front of my ankle as I’m walking. Tying the laces behind the tongue allows for me to get a tight fit around my ankle and eliminated any pressure any where on my ankles. I’ve not worn them out yet but the color scheme is so me and will go with anything! They are comfortable just walking around the house and on the treadmill to try them out longer before deciding on them. I’m very excited to have figured this out so I can keep them. I’m an 8.5 in most shoes and the last sorels I bought were that size. They fit perfect.
Guys… order a pair for your SO ASAP,9,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,These are better than any other girls boot in the market. Skip the Ugg’s or Sperry’s and try these first. Ever since I bought these my wife loves me more
Order half size up,9,"Black, Grill",5.0,"Perfect dogwalking shoes for muddy parks in the rainy months. Returned the size 9 shoes I usually wear, but the 9.5 were a great fit. Consider ordering half a size up."
Comfy,7,"Dove, Sea Sprite",5.0,Love these. Looks good and fits well. Love them.
Oh yes!,NA,NA,5.0,"I opted for these boots - who can go wrong with Sorel? - after another pair of Columbia boots were just to warm. These are good looking as well as comfortable. I may use pedi socks inside or perhaps without socks all together. I have big feet - women's 11.5-12 and often feel like I'm lugging boats on my feet...nothing graceful about it. Yet these boots make me feel graceful and they even walk well, like a shoe, not a boot. So happy I found them. I got the grey wool which offers a nice clean up look. They are a bit pricey but arrived when promised so I'm ready for winter!"
Amazingly comfortable,9.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"I am a athletic shoe wearing girl. That’s pretty much all I wear. I needed a good waterproof shoe that I could wear with regular jeans and skinny jeans. When the weather is wet here in western Oregon, I hate having my toes soaking wet through my shoes. I bought these and actually had to buy 3 pairs to get the right size. I own a pair of Sorel caribou boots and they are 9s so I went with that but they were too small. I ended up with a size 10 after a couple returns. These are the most comfortable shoes, they fit perfectly with my insoles as well!"
Excellent boot,8,"Taffy, Black",5.0,Love everything about these boots. Although I typically wear a 7.5 and had to return and size up to an 8 with these so they may run a tad small
I love them,6.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"I don’t normally spend a lot of money on shoes but this was worth every penny! They are the perfect casual boot for fall/winter. They keep my feet warm and dry. They go with so many outfits!
I don’t tie them tight because it does do something weird to the tongue and can be a little uncomfortable, but even with them tied loosely they don’t slip off when I walk.
I loved them so much I just bought some dressy sneakers from the same brand and I love them too."
I had to add a insole but I love them,7.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,I have gotten so many compliments on these when I wear them they fit good except I did add a softer insole I wear a 7 I ordered a 71/2
"Good Quality, go half size up",8.5,"Black, Grill",5.0,"Love these boots, really sharp looking. They keep your feet dry and so far, have given good traction in the slush and snow.
I read that Sorel tends to run small, so I ordered a full size up, anticipating wearing wool socks with these boots. They are a bit big, but fine for what I need. I would only go up a half size, if at all.
Ideally, I wanted to wear these boots with leggings and wool socks. The boots are a little shorter than I expected so the wool socks come up a little higher then I'd like. I thought they would lace up higher on my leg as well, but are easy to slide on and off since they don't."
Size up a whole size,10,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"These are definitely my favorite boots! I was really frustrated with how many times I had to order them to get the right size though. How is it possible that I wear a 9 in ALL other brands and types of shoes/boots, but these I had to size up a whole size?? Other than the pain in the neck of sending back the size 9 and the size 9.5, to finally get the size 10, these are great boots. Highly recommend getting them, just wish Sorel could get the sizes right. Size up!"
Love these,7.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,I love these and wear them all the time. It so nice to have something waterproof that can be worn for so many reasons
How can you say anything bad??!!!,9,"Taffy, Black",5.0,"They are an athleisure bootie. They aren’t meant to go skiiing or romping through the snow but are my everyday bootie to work and school, so cute and comfy!! I’d say as water resistant as a shoe maybe a tad more. SO CUTE, I get compliments all the time. It snowed today in Wisconsin, yes Oct. 14th and these made it a little better. ;)"
Not real sorel boots,8,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,I bought these sept 24th 2022 and wore them about 10 times and the toe is already busted opened. I work with kids so I'm not doing a lot in these boots and I've never ever ever ever have had this problem with sorel boots I've bought from a department store. But these that I bought online are NOT durable. DO NOT BUY
Great quality and comfort,7.5,"Black, Sea Salt",5.0,"Bought these for my wife, she loves them, very comfy, stylish and waterproof. She likes to wear thick socks so I bought half size larger than the size she normally wears which worked well for her"
Super cute!,10.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"Super cute Sorel boots!! They could use a little more cushion I think. Feet ache a bit after wearing and being on my feet all day in them, but style over comfort - am I right? ;). The s in the bottom on the inside of one of them has wore off already and it’s been about 2 1/2 months of having them, but I’ve worn them pretty steady and like I said, am on my feet all day when wearing them. Super cute boots!"
LOVE THESE BOOTS,NA,NA,5.0,"I love everything about these boots! Color (creamy white) is very nice. I wear a 7 1/2 to an 8, and I have a wide foot at the front. Bought an 8 and they are the perfect fit. Very comfortable!!!! Almost makes me excited for the snow."
Super Cute runs small,8.5,"Taffy, Black",5.0,Really cute and comfortable. They do run small. I usually wear an 8 in boots and 39 EU are usually way roomy enough. I got an 8 1/2 in these and they are snug and toes touch the front
I'm in love,7.5,"White, Cyber Yellow",5.0,New favorite boots! They fit very well (sometimes sorel is too big or small depending on style but not these).
Super comfortable and keeps feet warm,NA,NA,5.0,"Absolutely love these boots. Love that they keep my feet warm and dry. They do run a little big but will be nice to wear thick socks with. Easy to get on, keeps my feet dry and warm! Great quality and fashionable boot!"
Better than I even expected!,8,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,These are warm but not heavy. The arch support is fantastic. I absolutely love these!! Living in the upper Midwest I need daily winter boots that aren’t bulky. These are great!
Comfort and size,10,"White, Cyber Yellow",5.0,I usually were a 9.5 and ordered a 10. Fits just right but will hav me no room for a sock. Returning and ordering a 10.5. Order a full size up if you will wear a thin to thick sock. Other than that they are comfortable and stylish.
Love,7,"Taffy, Black",5.0,These are so cute and I get so many compliments on them. Also very comfortable.
Loooove,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"I finally made the splurge and for myself a pair just so my feet won’t freeze wearing slip on shoes. I wear a size 8.5 and they fit perfect after being broken in. We haven’t had a lot of snow to fully test them out, but I’m sure they’ll do great."
I love these boots. They are flattering on and so warm and comfortable!,8.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",5.0,Love these boots. They are flattering on and very warm and comfortable. I bought 1/2 size bigger and it's perfect.
Order 1/2 size up if you plan to wear thick socks!,8,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,Fantastic pair of shoes! I ordered 1/2 size up because I planned to wear thick socks and that was fine. I could probably gone up 1 whole size and been fine as well.
Must have!,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,I purchased these a half size bigger so I could slide them on and off at work as I have to go out into the elements often but work in an office environment
Warm and Cozy in Montana Snow,10,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"These boots are the cutest! I've worn them with dress pants and jeans. As a realtor, I slog through some cold, wet conditions in Montana. These boots are cute and comfy. My thicker Sorel boots are better for longer times in the snow, but these are great for everyday."
Everyday winter boot,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"Love these boots! My daughter had some that she loves also. I have inserts from the good feet store and had to buy boots for the winter, so I bought a size up. With the foam pads and the inserts, my feet now feel great and supported, and also waterproof! Love them"
Cute and functional!,NA,NA,5.0,"I know they are not extremely warm, but they are definitely waterproof. Went thru thick wet snow this morning and my feet stayed dry! Even after walking thru about 4 inches of slush today also!"
FAV BOOTS ever,7,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,I love Sorel and this is by far my most FAV pair ever! They go with so much and are just perfect. I ordered a half size up :-)
Comfort & Warmth all around NYC in January,6,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"Added an insert. Wore for a week long visit to NYC in January. Warm, dry, comfortable for hours of walking each day. Does not provide ankle support."
My New Favorite Brand,NA,NA,5.0,Although Sorels are a little bit pricey I have to say I will definitely look forward to starting a collection of them. This has been the absolutely most comfortable boot/ shoe i have worn in a very long time. The durability and water resistant is perfect for my everyday use when walking/ running my Rotti in all types of weather conditions. This shoe has the feel of a very supportive sneaker. Excellent quality and style. The unique back is eye catching as well. Enjoy!
Perfect for cold weather,8.5,"Taffy, Black",5.0,"Excellent boots. Very comfortable to walk around in during the winter. They keep the slush, snow and cold out without over heating your feet. Love these! Would get them in every color"
YES YES 🙌🏼,8,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,Get you some now! True to size and STUPID CUTE! I have gotten so many compliments on these shoes.
Winner,6.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",5.0,Sorels always a good choice. Comfortable.
Good fit,9,"Black, Sea Salt",5.0,Good fit
Sorel ankle boot - non-skid sole - LOVE these!!,NA,NA,5.0,"Saw a friend with this boot and fell in love!! How did I live without it in WI?
Style - comfort - function.
Note - I wear thick socks in WI - order up 1/2 size."
Sorel is worth the HIPE!,7,"Omega Taupe, Black",5.0,"Super cute, comfy, and great for cold, wet weather."
Really nice and comfortable boots,8,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"These boots are waterproof, durable, comfortable, stylish and more I wore these in Washington on a very rainy day and they kept my feet nice and toasty. They are perfect for hiking or walking and comfort. I totally recommend."
"Stylish, true to size just gotta break them in",9,"Taffy, Black",5.0,"I have a size 9 foot and prefer “wide” when that is an option. I read many reviews saying runs small, so i was going to order the 9.5, however, was turned off that a half size up was like $50 more. After wearing these boots with regular socks, they become more and more comfortable! So happy i went with the 9s. I get compliments every time i wear them, and they add a little height to my short stature!"
Tal y como me lo esperaba,9,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,Excelente calidad
Comfortable,10,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,The boots are very comfortable!
The most amazing foot wear ever!,9,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"Light as a feather , ankle support and dirt resistant. My favorite kicks ever"
Boots,7,"Omega Taupe, Black",5.0,"Like everything about them. Looks, comfort, usage, and price."
These are great,10,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"I love these boots!! They are so cute and comfortable. Best of all, they slip on and off and are light weight!!"
Love these.,9,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"When I tried these on with the cool socks, I thought they were way too small. I then tried them on with regular cotton socks and they fit perfect. Although they’re waterproof, they do not cause sweaty feet, which was surprising."
I love these boots. Excellent quality.,7,"Dove, Sea Sprite",5.0,Very cute and the quality is excellent! They are also surprisingly comfortable!
Exactly as expected.,9,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,No problems exactly as expected
Exactly Right,8,"Taffy, Black",5.0,"I am super happy with this product, everything was as I expected. The only comfort issue is just breaking them in. Other than that super happy with my purchase."
Love these!!,10,"Taffy, Black",5.0,So cute
Good quality product,8,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,So cute and good quality
so cute!!,5.5,"Camel Brown, Black",5.0,"I am absolutely obsessed with these boots. I love them and wear them to walk the dogs and run errands. I don’t feel like they are fully weather proof though. I’ve had them less than 2 months with normal light wear and the rubber on the toe is already coming apart too. I wanted to exchange them but were out of my size. Really disappointed they aren’t better quality, I expected them to last years and years but they definitely won’t. Still cute though."
Love my shoes!!!!!!,8,"Omega Taupe, Black",5.0,They are so comfortable!!!! I get so many compliments too!
Stylish,9.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",5.0,Super cute
Comfortable,7.5,"Taffy, Black",5.0,Sorel are the best boots! No break in time at all. You can put these boots on right out of the box. They are so cute!
Wonderful,9.5,"Taffy, Black",5.0,"I wanted these for my daily walks with my dog, for the New England winter weather..they are perfect and very comfy like a sneaker"
Perfect boots,8,"Taffy, Black",5.0,These boots are not only comfortable and stylish but more importantly they keep my feet warm!
Great quality,10,"Taffy, Black",5.0,Didn't appreciate having a 32.00 restocking fee plus 15.00 more for a larger size
Daughter in law loves them,9,"Taffy, Black",5.0,"Good comfort, warm and water proof . Support is ok , could be better."
Very Cute!,7,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,Super cute. Easy to wear. Comfortable and true to size.
Super cute & light weight,9,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"Order 1/2 size up due to previous reviews, but the normal size would have fit fine. I had to add sole inserts to make up for the looseness even with boot socks the extra 1/2 size was too much. Overall, I like a little room in my shoes so I will definitely be keeping them. Only complaint is the tongue is stiff & sort pokes the top of my foot where the tongue is sewn in. I have to position it or don’t tie the laces real tight. I have worn them all day on multiple occasions without issues."
Stiff But Cute,12,"Omega Taupe, Black",4.0,"Very stiff no arch support, but cute and I got inserts. Runs a size small, as sorels usually do. Not as tennis shoe like as they look, more like duck boots."
very good produce,9,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,very good product
Fashion not warmth,7,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"These boots are super cute and I get a ton of compliments every time I wear them. They’re perfect for running errands and look stylish. However, they are not ideal for warmth especially if you live in the north or actual cold temperature regions. I would buy them again as they are great when you are moving around or just want dry feet. Not warm enough for a cold ice rink or cold temperatures."
Stylish and comfortable for med-wide feet,9.5,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"I love these boots. They're really cute and comfortable. I would say if you're considering buying them, to purchase a size up. I normally wear a 9.5, but had to reorder a 10. I'd also add that these are a good boot for folks with medium to wide feet. I've got narrow feet and have to double up on socks."
Not quite enough insulation for Minnesota winter!,7,"Taffy, Black",4.0,Little too stiff and needs more insulation.
These run about a half size small,11,"Taffy, Black",4.0,These are a good boot not the most comfortable shoe but these run a bit small. I'm an 11 and these feel more like a 10.5. Mine were used when I ordered them new. They were a return and it was obvious when I opened the box right away. Tags were off and soles were not clean ect. So not a great shoe for long walks but they look nice and keep your feet dry!
Near perfect…,8,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"I love the style, color, comfort, small elevation from the heel and durability/water resistance. Near perfect with a few suggested adjustments: I hate the visible seam on the tongue… it doesn’t sit under the laces and I actually wish there were no laces, but instead elastic bands to provide for quick pull on and off. Still those are minor and these are still my fave cold/wet weather shoes."
Boots are stylish,7.5,"Black, Grill",4.0,"These are good boots to keep your feet dry and warm.
If you want to wear thicker socks - size up - they are a bit snug in the toe area. Not great arch support - I had to add an arch support insert- careful not to intrude on toe area tho - arch support was only in arch area. Not as big and bulky as other warm boots which is why I liked them."
New favorite boots until they broke,NA,NA,4.0,"I have always loved the look and quality of Sorel. My other 5 pairs have lasted years. This pair was great, able to wear casually and for walks/hikes. Unfortunately after mild wear for 3 weeks the strap that holds the top lace broke off. So disappointed. I don’t feel like I should have to pay to repair a basically new boot but now they are back ordered."
Great looking shoe with zero support,9.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",4.0,"I loved the look of these boots. Easy on and off. Perfect for snowy/rainy springs and fall weather. My only complaint is they have zero support and if on m feet for long period, shopping, etc. my feet and legs ache."
Cute and waterproof,6.5,"Black, Sea Salt",4.0,Looked forward to receiving these .. wore them right away for a couple of weeks — toes started to hurt.. they are too small. Order a 1/2 to full size up.. also there is no provision/cushion for the foot pad area in front.. your foot can feel the ground .. I would buy again but not without right insert and definitely a size larger .
"Well made, but runs small...",7.5,"Black, Grill",4.0,"Great shoe. Very well made. Ordered my usual size, 7.5. But... they were too tight. My toe was right up against the toe box. Width was fine. I have ordered an 8 and hope they will be a perfect fit."
Very comfortable boots.,9,"Taffy, Black",4.0,Very comfortable boots and water resistant. However I do wish Sorrel would have made the toe box larger. It would have added comfort and a better look to the boot. Overall I am happy with my purchase!
Scratches,9,"Taffy, Black",4.0,"The boots came with a couple of scratches on them but otherwise they were fine. I wear between an 8 1/2 and a 9, and am glad I bought the size 9."
Not completely water resistant go up a half size,7,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,I love sorel boots and sneakers. These are terrific but they do leak a little with a lot of water and I had to go up a half size
Wish they laced better,9.5,"Black, Sea Salt",4.0,"They look great and the size is as expected, but because the material around the ankle is so thick the laces don't allow them to actually fit tightly around the ankle so the foot slides around inside, feels like there's not enough room for my toes when I'm walking."
Great look and quality!,9.5,"Black, Grill",4.0,"I only gave it 4 stars because it hasn't snowed here yet. But from what I know of Sorrel, I'm sure they will be fine. They are very comfortable."
Cute but not comfortable,12,"Black, Grill",4.0,"These boots are super cute, and true to size. However, they are not very comfortable and I will probably not wear them very much due to that reason."
Super cute but size is up,9,"Black, Sea Salt",4.0,Love these casual boots but they seem to run a little small. I am a solid 9 in most brands (including other SOREL boots) and my toe hit the front of these. Sizing is definitely a bit off. I returned and ordered a half size larger - hoping that works!
Runs small,7,"Black, Sea Salt",4.0,These shoes are very nice looking. They are super lightweight and comfortable. I’m glad I read the reviews because these shoes run VERY small. I’m a 6 in sneakers and 6.5 in boots. I’ve bought these in a size 7 and they’re just big enough.
"Good looking shoe,",8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,", not for someone who has foot issues - no support in the soles."
Expensive but nice boot,7,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,Don’t go in to deep of water
So comfortable!,8,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,Purchased as a Christmas gift to use during holidays. Will update when I know more.
A little tight in the forefoot.,9,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,They are tight in the forefoot but will probably be okay in successive wearing.
I have another pair also,NA,NA,4.0,I like the new colors. Always have a pair or two in my closet
Love them!!,7,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,I love these boots!
Comfortable,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,Comfortable and true to size.
"Nice quality, a bit bulky",8.5,"Black, Sea Salt",4.0,"Fast ship, nice quality, a bit heavy and bulky"
Great for rain + snow,9,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"Super cute booties for rain + snow! They’re comfy, waterproof, lightweight, + warm. I’m normally a 5.5 or 6, but I would recommend going a half size up if you would be wearing thick socks with these."
Weirdly a lot smaller than my other Sorels,10,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"I was so excited to get these (they are soooo cute), but they are weirdly a lot smaller than my other Sorels that are the same size (both size 9, pictured). I reordered the next size up (9.5) and am hoping they work because they seem great other than that!
UPDATE: The 9.5s came in and they fit! So, I recommend sizing up a half size."
Cute! But not really a cold weather/winter boot,NA,NA,4.0,"Cute boot! I ordered a 7 which is my usual size. I probably should have gone up 1/2 size up for two reasons: (1) I have one foot that is slightly bigger than the other. The first several wears, my big toe was hitting the top of the boot. Now that its a bit more broken it, I don't notice so much. (2) Thicker socks. These boots are not all that warm. In temps below freezing, I can feel my toes getting cold even with what should be warm enough socks. If you're looking for a winter boot/shoe, this may not be it. But if you're looking for a light weight, waterproof, can-get-dirty, type of boot - this is the one."
Needs more cushioning,NA,NA,4.0,"Saw the good reviews so decided to order for an Ohio winter. Overall this is a good boot but runs slightly small. The tongue doesn’t lay flat and there is barely any cushioning in the sole. I wouldn’t want to walk far in these, but they are ok for running errands. On a positive note they are very warm."
"Cute, comfortable, but won't keep your feet warm .",9,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"I love how these boots look and they are comfortable but with in a minute of being out in the snow my feet were freezing. So, if your looking for boots that will keep your feet warm, I would say these are not what you should get."
ORDER ONE SIZE UP!!!,10.5,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"I wear a 10...I went to DSW to try them on, but they only had an 11, which I tried on (with ""regular"" socks) and thought they were too big...So, I ordered a 10.5 from Amazon.

Once, I tried them on with winter socks , they were even to small...My toe was right at the tip of the shoe!!!

Going up and half size, didn't work for me...GO UP ONE WHOLE SIZE!!!

Exchanging for the 11 because they were super cute on!!! ENJOY!!!

EDIT!!! The 11 is right!!! Aye!!!"
"runs a tad small, especially with thick socks",7,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"love it, just returning for a half size bigger"
Size-Up,9,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,Super cute shoes! Not much foot padding and no arch support but still comfortable. Purchased a 1/2 size larger than I normally wear and they fit perfectly.
Nice boot - size up,NA,NA,4.0,"I really liked the boot. I tried on my normal shoe size and 1 size bigger. I definitely needed to go with the larger size. One thing to note, there is NO arch support in this boot. if you are planning to wear for a prolonged period of time i recommend getting a sole insert with arch support. Other than that the boot is very cute. I got the grey with tan leather accents and they are really cute. I did not feel like the boots were overly heavy."
Great Shoe - Runs Small,7.5,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"Love these boots. Definitely not the comfiest show ever, especially if you are in the mountains but for sure a durable boot. If you plan to wear warm socks with them I would size up."
NA,8,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"While these boots will probably not be warm for long this winter, I kept them anyway, because they are adorable. I have a size 8 foot and sometimes I feel like boots make my feet look huge. These ones do not. I won’t be able to wear very thick socks with them as they are on the smaller side for the size."
NA,9,"Omega Taupe, Black",4.0,"These will be nice and warm for the winter, but not much support. I do a lot of walking in the winter so I will need to purchase some insoles. Kinda surprising considering the price of these boots."
NA,9,"Taffy, Black",4.0,Love them I’m hoping to wear them in and they stretch a little.
NA,9,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"I got the grey, brown and black shoes and they fit normally. I wear 8.5, but so many people mentioned they were small so I got a 9. 9 is big on me, 8.5 would have been perfect. Oh well.

Pros: I've ended up keeping the size 9 because the 8.5 is more than $300 for some reason.
But they are lightweight and comfy. I walked around in them for a few hours inside and outside (2 degrees celsius), and my feet were dry and warm the entire time.
They are really cute and different looking.

Cons: you can't tighten the laces to fit your foot size, the tongue just wrinkles up, as it is sewn into place. You can only tighten the top loop so they at least stay on your feet."
NA,9,"Camel Brown, Black",4.0,"I usually wear an 8.5/9 so I ordered the 9 based on other reviews to size up. My toes still touched the end on my larger foot and I actually found them to feel a bit like a Kleenex box on my foot at first, but as I have worn them they have stretched out a bit and formed to my feet and are super comfy! Breaking in nicely with no blisters or sore spots yet. They’re warm, although only tested in fall Alberta weather - hopefully they’re still warm in winter. So overall, I’m pleased with my first online shoe purchase!"
NA,8,"Taffy, Black",4.0,A great boot for work. Comfortable enough to get through a work day and my feet don't over heat. The grips are a little sucky so not great for icy weather. There is a slight improper sewing job on one of the tongues that bothered me in the beginning.
NA,8,"Black, Grill",4.0,"Fit is good - I usually have problems with bunion on one foot so it’s good that it is deep and wide enough in front.
It is not as well insulated as expected but I’ve had no problems with being out for an hour or more with temperatures around 0C."
NA,10,"Omega Taupe, Black",4.0,"J’aime beaucoup le look, j’aurais aimé que les lacets soient élastiques, on ne pouvait pas voir sur la photo que c’étaient des lacets conventionnels… j’ai bien peur qu’elle ne soient pas assez chaudes pour des températures canadiennes en hiver!"
NA,8,"Black, Grill",4.0,Perfect shoe for fall but very small sizing.
Just ok boots.,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"Love the boot. But have to give 3 stars. The rubber came detached from the boot in a few places after wearing them only few times. Not on only one boot, but both boots. I wasn't too happy after what I payed for them."
"In the end, good boots",NA,NA,3.0,"Originally bought a pair, but after 2 months they began leaking, which these boots are NOT supposed to do. I contacted sorel customer service but because I purchased on Amazon they couldn't help me. I expressed my disappointment with their product regardless of retailer. Anyway, I returned the first set and bought another set, and it's been 4 months of wear and they're fine. My only other complaint is that the white sole does not clean easily. Otherwise love these. Next time, I will purchase directly from sorel, not Amazon."
Sorel hit the mark with looks but uncomfortable,9.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",3.0,"Normal size 9.5… could’ve got a 10
Good looking boots but the insole is not worth the price tag. Going to buy inserts. I do not have foot issues, so it’s the boots!!!"
Great boots,8.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",3.0,"I love these boots, they are so comfy and stylish. The only issue is that the rubber sole is coming away from the shoe. The return window is closed so I have to live with it or glue it back. Not what I would expect from Sorel."
This product runs small in length. Size up! The tongue doesn't lay down smooth on sides.,7,"Omega Taupe, Black",3.0,This product runs small be sure to size up! The tongue also doesn't lay flat on each side may be uncomfortable while wearing. Will be returning
Shoes,9,"Taffy, Black",3.0,Have only worn these a few times and the cream part of the sole of the shoe is coming detached. Still really like the shoe but feel like my foot might get wet if it is wet outside.... disappointing
Fit,9.5,"Black, Grill",3.0,Although I have several other pairs of Sorel boots all in size 9.5. I was VERY disappointed when these FINALLY came as they run small and didn't fit.
Very narrow,8,"Omega Taupe, Black",3.0,They were cute but very narrow in the toes. Had to return.
Worn out after 1 year,NA,NA,3.0,I love the style and fit. I wore them for the spring and winter season in MN and after a year they started splitting at the seams in the front. The bottom also wore through and I can’t wear them any longer. Really bummed the quality isn’t what I expected from sorel.
Love these boots!,10,"Omega Taupe, Black",3.0,"Love these, comfy & perfect for everyday winter weather. Will buy again!"
Cute but not as expected,9.5,"Fawn, Sea Salt",3.0,These are definitely cute but not the quality I would expect from sorel. The boot insert doesn’t give you much support or cushion at all. I will probably be getting new inserts. Also the upper part of the boot is thin without any padding to make them a cozy winter boot. I’m a bit disappointed for the price point that sorel didn’t make these boots a little better quality. I usually wear a 9 but sized up to a 9.5. Sorel usually runs a bit small.
Tongue is screwed up,9.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",3.0,I think for 130 dollars the workmanship could be better. The tongues don’t lie flat no matter what I do. Other than that I do like them.
Sole is falling apart.,7,"Black, Grill",3.0,"Play Video
 This is my second pair of these I use them for slipping on to take my kids to school. Haven't had this pair for 3 weeks and lightly worn as we are not having rain yet for the season and the sole is falling apart. Not impressed."
Runs small,7.5,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,These boots came and were too small. I ordered a half size up and they were still too small. I won’t purchase again:(
Sole is separating after 6 weeks of use,9,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,The sole separate from the front of the boot - very disappointing seeing that these are work boots and $125+
Different Fit,8.5,"Black, Sea Salt",3.0,Tongue is loose and can’t be tight to your feet.
Cute boots - but Form over function.,9,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"These booties are really cute and comfortable enough (they aren’t uncomfortable). They’re great for keeping your feet warm and dry as long as you’re not in much snow (any more than an inch or two and you’ve got snow in your boots). The soles do not have good/any traction, so be extra careful when it’s slick out.

I usually wear and 8.5 and that was too small when I put med-thick socks on. Upsized to a 9 and they work great with thin or thick wool socks."
Runs big size down,9,"Omega Taupe, Black",3.0,Great boot just ran a size too big. Perfect for the cold on days when snow isn’t too deep.
Good + bad,5,"Black, Sea Salt",3.0,"The footbed fit was perfect and they are very comfortable to walk in. However, the where the tongue meets the boot is not perfect and creates a little bump that can poke into your foot, so it has to be adjusted a lot. The other issue that I didn't see from the pictures is that the toe of the boot is rubber/plastic, like duck boots. Personally my feet get too cold in that material. I won't send back because they are pretty comfortable, just not what I was looking for."
Wish I had sized up,7,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"I normally wear a 6 1/2 in every shoe, so I took the comment advice and bought a 7. I received them and my toe is still pretty snug to them. I would like to go up another half size however I already waiting longer than planned for these so I don’t really want to wait again. The shoes themselves though are so frickin cute!!!!"
Okay,9.5,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"They are cute, but the tongue is uncomfortable and it doesn’t tie well. I returned them."
Runs small,NA,NA,3.0,"These run small, i am normally a size 9 in boots but if i were to keep them i would have had to size up to 9.5
I also thought the side of the shoe was a smooth material in the picture but its rough wool like material so they will be going back…"
Not warm. At all.,7,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,These are spring and fall boots only. Winter? Plan on shoving a super thick sock inside and you might be okay.
Wish they had half sizes,9.5,"Black, Sea Salt",3.0,"I really like the boot overall, but wish it came in half sizes. Ordered a size 9 and it was WAY too small. Ordered a 10 and it’s very big. I decided to keep in hoping I could wear a thick sock and break them in, but I’ve just opted not too wear them much."
Cute but not practical,8,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,I love how cute these look but for the price you’d expect them to be warm and comfortable. I had to buy thick boot socks for them to be warm enough to wear in the winter.
Cute style,8,"Taffy, Black",3.0,Very cute style but not super practical. Very short on the ankle if you deal with Midwest snow & the rubber toes are pretty cold so thick socks are necessary. They also run alittle small so I recommend ordering a 1/2 size up.
Cute little boots,NA,NA,3.0,I love the look of these boots but I ended up returning them because they ran extremely small. I am a typical 7.5 in all shoes and these fit more like a 7
Thin,8,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,I love the look of these boots. I’ve received many compliments. They are a little thin and have very little padding. I guess I expected more comfort and quality from Sorel.
This boot hits a little high in the ankle and is stiff.,7,"Black, Sea Salt",3.0,These boots hurt my ankles.
Uncomfortable,NA,NA,3.0,"Returned. Gorgeous to look at, but created indentations on the top of my foot in the hour I wore in the house. Mostly sitting, and still uncomfortable."
Sized up and still too small,9.5,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"These are so cute! Wish they’d fit. I sized up and they are still too small.

Overall, I think they’re great. I just wish they would fit."
Size up!,9.5,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,I have been size 9.5 my whole life. These were way to tight at size 9.5. No insulation inside either; as expected.
Only so so,9,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,So cute but not nearly as comfortable as I wanted. Tight and stiff and no real cushion in the footbed.
A little uncomfortable,9,"Taffy, Black",3.0,"Super cute looking, but the tongue where it is sewed onto the boot has a big bump and hurts the top of your foot."
"Super cute, not super comfortable",8,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"These shoes are obviously cute! The comfort is lacking. For this price range, I expect the good looks and comfort."
Wasn't for me,10.5,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,They were just too heavy.
Not comfortable,10,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,True to size but uncomfortable boot
Purchased size 11. Fits like a 10,NA,NA,3.0,Purchased a size 11. Fits like a size 10.
Cute but shirt in the toe box area,11,"Black, Sea Salt",3.0,Toe box short
Shoes too narrow,10,"Black, Sea Salt",3.0,Shoes too narrow
"Nice Boot, but the rubber pulled apart from the sole",9,"Dove, Sea Sprite",3.0,The rubber has pulled apart from the sole. I am having a hard time getting the boot replaced. Sorel as a company won't replace it because it was purchased through Amazon.
"Good, but Disappointing",11,"Taffy, Black",3.0,"I expected better. Purchased direct from Sorel, I have had these for a year. For $120 I feel like they should be more comfortable and not be as worn as they are. I like them enough that I wear them almost daily in the winter, but I want to like them so much more than I actually do. They fit and feel like rain boots, they don’t hug your feet like sneakers, the toe box is wide (great for thick socks) and has plenty of room, but I feel like my feet slide around in them. They are waterproof but definitely not warm for walking in snow for any length of time. They are cute and stylish, as well as versatile, but with the wear on the felt inside, as well as the cracked rubber where my foot bends I don’t feel like they look as nice nor have they held up as well as they should have. I expected more from this brand."
Not the quality expected for the brand,7.5,"Taffy, Black",3.0,"Cute boots, I’ve had them for two weeks and worn them almost every day (wet weather). They started coming apart after only a few days. The tongue is pretty uncomfortable and I was expecting a little more foot support. There isn’t much. There is probably a better boot out there for the price."
"Cute, but lacks in comfort.",7,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"Very cute boots, but lacks in comfort. The top of the boot where the tongue lays is not comfortable. If you tie it tighter it hurts so I have to keep the boots loose. I would say I have an average foot. My foot is a little wide at the metatarsal joint and these boots fit fine. For what you pay and the brand of the boot I would expect a little more comfort."
NA,7.5,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,Thought they'd be warmer to wear. Toes get cold when in snow to long.
NA,9,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,"However, comfort is just ok. The insole is slippery and due to slight height to heel, foot slides forward (they are not too big). I switched out with a memory foam insole and it's better, but would definitely not wear for long walking ""out and abouts""!"
NA,7.5,"Black, Sea Salt",3.0,I bought Sorel because I wanted a short warm boot. These are definitely short enough but they are not warm enough. There's not much insulation in the toe of the boot and my toes get cold.
NA,8,"Camel Brown, Black",3.0,Love them for spring/fall time! Not warm enough for winter. Feet are cold just at -10.
NA,9,"Black, Grill",3.0,The boots are very confortable and great looking but i wish they would keep your feet warmer!
NA,NA,NA,3.0,Not good for -20 weather
Boots run small. Plan for that when you purchase.,7.5,"Black, Grill",2.0,"I normally wear 7.0 but purchased 7.5 to be safe. Even at 7.5, the boots are still a bit small. This rating is just for size and the trouble you may have getting the right fit without trying them on 1st and without having to return them. This is the 2nd time I have purchased Sorel on-line and the 2nd time I have returned them (the 1st time I purchased true to size).

I was unable to exchange to the right size with the 1st purchase because they were out of stock in the size that I needed. It sounds like this is an issue you could have to deal with, also. Once your size is out of stock, they cannot tell you when they will have new inventory so you will just have to return the ones that don't fit.

Other than that, the boots were cute and I was bummed that I could not get them
I don't have experience with wearing the boots (the boots performance) to report on, however.
My overall purchasing experience and Customer Service quotient has been less than ideal, unfortunately."
Too stiff at the toe,5,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,I loved these boots they were so cute and I really wanted them to work for me. That's why I traded them in for a half size larger as my toe hitted the edge of the shoe. However it still was uncomfortable because the shoe was so stiff. It's not because it's new but because the way its made. I'm disappointed I had to return it.
"Cute and comfy, not well made.",7.5,"Dove, Sea Sprite",2.0,"I loved these feom the day I got them. They are comfy and lightweight which is what I was looking for. Great for everyday use. I had already read reviews saying they weren't very warm and I agree, not great if you plan to be outside long term. I gave a low rating because after about 3 months of wear the soles are already coming apart from the shoe. They no longer are waterproof and for the price and brand I expected these to last years. Disappointed for sure. Would not buy again simply because of this."
Boot toe split open,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,Within 4 months of owning them and wearing maybe once a week the toes of the boots have split open and let in water/snow/dirt etc. Super bummed out that I paid so much for them and only got a few months of use out of then.
I really like these a lot but the size I ordered was not the correct size in the box,9.5,"Taffy, Black",2.0,"I really like the look of these a lot but the size I ordered was not the correct size in the Box! Patiently, Waiting for return so I can repurchase……."
Pay attention to reviews,8.5,"Taffy, Black",2.0,"I really wanted to love these shoes, but I should have listened to the reviews. First, the shoes DO run small. I am a 7.5, but I always purchase a size 8 in boots so that I can wear thick socks if necessary. I followed the recommendations and ended up ordering an 8.5. They fit, but I probably could have gone up to a 9.

The reviews complaining about the tongue are CORRECT. The tongue of this boot is so incredibly uncomfortable. It is stiff, hard and rubs like crazy on the top part of your foot. For this reason I has to return these boots. I thought maybe they just needed to stretch a bit. I wore them all day in my home walking around and they never got better. I was in so much pain; I wanted to cry."
"Cute, that's about it.",NA,NA,2.0,"I needed proper winter boots. These were too low, thin (not warm enough), and didn't offer any arch support. Overpriced for not being very functional. I returned them."
Defective,10,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,First snow of the winter for me and they separated and my feet are getting wet. Past the return date because I bought them early for snow. No listed customer solution for a return or to let the seller know they’re new and this happened wearing them for the first time. Disappointed. I like the shoe but would like a resolution given how much I paid.
Already breaking?,7.5,"Taffy, Black",2.0,"I loved these at first. Comfortable for long city walks in rain and snow. The tongue was a concern at first, but once they were broken in it was no longer an issue. I haven’t even had these through a whole midwestern winter and they are already starting to come apart. Disappointing as I had an expectation that the price would have gotten me at least 2 seasons of wear."
Cute but very Uncomfortable,8.5,"Dove, Sea Sprite",2.0,Really liked the style of these but they were extremely uncomfortable. The fit was fine but the area around the ankles pressed in across the back of my ankle causing painful blisters.
Falling Apart,8.5,"Black, Grill",2.0,I was excited about these boots because the brand is usually pretty quality. I haven’t even had them six months (and switch off with another pair of boots) and the sole is already coming apart. Pretty dissatisfied especially because of the price. My target boots have held up way better for the last year. Hopefully this helps someone when deciding to purchase or not.
Do not do the job,9,"Dove, Sea Sprite",2.0,"They are so low that when the snow left a dusting on the ground it still got in my shoes. They make my feet look wide, their not comfortable and my feet were freezing in them the entire time!"
Cold,7,"White, Cyber Yellow",2.0,"These shoes make my toes freeze. I even wear two layers of socks, but the shoe makes my feet freeze. I'm outside for 1 hour or more, and it's tortur.. for 120$ too I thought it would regulate the temperature or not be made with only one layer of rubber. So disappointed. Also, why are the boots so narrow? I have narrow feet but the boots are painfully too narrow."
"Cute, but didn’t last very long",9,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,"Bought these boots in November and by February, they were already starting to come apart. Unfortunate because they were very cute and comfortable, just not very dependable."
Hole in edge already,9.5,"Black, Grill",2.0,"ordered in December got them in January, wore them once and got a hole in them. The hole just keeps getting bigger and not the insides get wet. contacted seller and still no answer."
No traction on the bottom for snow/ice,9.5,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,These shoes are cute but that's about it. NO traction on the bottom for our snowy Wisconsin weather.
Separating after 2 months,10,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,"Waited months to order these because of price. Finally decided and was so excited. But after normal wear (mostly indoors) the seals are starting to separate. Very disappointing.
Minor issue at this point but I expect will continue to separate to be worse."
"Tight in length, plenty of room width wise",9,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,I'd size up a half size. I normally wear a 9 and my toes touch the front of the boot making it uncomfortable.
Falling apart after only a couple of weeks- returning!!!,9,"Taffy, Black",2.0,They are falling apart after just a couple of weeks! Luckily it is still in my return window but so disappointed! They are cute and wonder if I just got a bad pair… I want to buy them again but I am too scared
Defect in manufacturing of tongue,8,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,"The tongue of one of the boots was sewn incorrectly so it does not lie flat on the top of your foot and causes discomfort. It’s seems totally random. I have purchased these several times trying to get a pair with both made correctly. In these photos, the tongue on the right foot sits correctly and the one on the left bunches up because of the stitching. If you happen to get a pair made correctly, then they are good shoes, but you may get one or two shoes with defects that are too uncomfortable to wear."
Dissapointing,6,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,"I buy a new pair of Sorel boots every few years and they have always been excellent quality and really lasting. However, this pair was so cheaply made, oddly wide and way too light. There was almost no support and it was an overall disappointment. Returned them already."
Terrible in the snow,11,"Omega Taupe, Black",2.0,Silly me for thinking a boot that says good in the snow would actually be good in the snow. My toes are damp and cold just from walking to and from my car while out and about on a snowy day.
"Yes, they run small!",NA,NA,2.0,"I was hoping to be able to say I ordered my true size and they fit perfectly. Sadly, they’re too small even with thin socks, as most other reviewers have said. Probably 1/2 size up would solve the problem. Very light weight, and look good even in a size 12."
Size up if you’re going to get them,11,"Black, Grill",2.0,I really loved these boots but disappointed that I only got about 9 months out of them before they started tearing at the toe bend.. for $130 I would have like to get at least 2 years out of them. If you’re looking to buy these definitely size up. I’m normally a 10 and the 11 fit great
I Not happy- bottom of shoe coming unglued from white piping. 2 months old!,7.5,"Taffy, Black",2.0,"Very disappointed in this boot. Spent a lot of money on them and the haven’t lasted 2 months. I wear them once a week I’m good weather, rarely in rain. Bottom of boots is coming detached from the white piping. Thought they would last longer!!"
Painful to wear,8,"Taffy, Black",2.0,These had all the features I wanted in footwear for a quick run to the store in winter. I ordered 1/2 size larger than my normal shoe size and they fit just right…until I tied them up. The tongue folded funny and the hard leather poked into the top of my foot. It seems to be a design flaw that would not change if I “broke them in.” I could not bear to wear them even sitting. Returning them.
Didn’t last long,8,"Black, Grill",2.0,Christmas 2022 present for my daughter. She has not worn them that much and the rubber piece on the front is already coming apart.
Runs small,10,"Omega Taupe, Black",2.0,"So cute, but runs very small"
Sole separation,11,"Omega Taupe, Black",2.0,This is my second pair of these boots. I loved my first pair but this pair started falling apart after 3 weeks of light wear. The sole is separating.
Awkward fit,7.5,"Taffy, Black",2.0,I ended up returning these immediately. They did not fit the way they look like they would. No arch support and they just were not comfortable when laced up.
Runs small,10,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,Returned. Size up at least one size for correct fit
Who cut the tongue,8.5,"Black, Grill",2.0,There is barely a tongue in the boots.
Very poor quality!,11,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,"Do not wear this boot in the snow as the sole is flat and extremely slippery! The inner rubber sole is not up to Sorel quality as there is no liner, very uncomfortable after a short walk. I wear a 9.5 and purchased an 11 so as to wear wool socks and found the fit to be snug. Shame on Sorel for this poor quality boot!"
Great looking boot but fell apart in 3 months,10,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,Really like the look and feel of these boots but they started to break down at the seams within 3 months
Not for an extended period of time in the cold,8.5,"Black, Grill",2.0,"Very thin, probably good for walking from the car into work but, not much more then that. Wore them to my daughters soccer game last night was outside in dry conditions for 80 minutes in 40 degrees and couldn't feel my feet."
Too too small basic boot,9.5,"Dove, Sea Sprite",2.0,"Too too small boot. No inside padding. Minimal sole treads - only 2-3 mm. Not Ideal for icy , wet, or slippery surfaces if you are looking for gripping sole. Seemed sturdy with a thick sole."
Odd fit,9,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,"These boots were somehow too small and too large at the same time. The tops were rigid and irritated my ankles/shins. After wearing them around the house for an hour, they started to squeak? I'm so confused. I wanted to LOVE these, but they really were a massive let down."
Run big and not comfortable,NA,NA,2.0,They run big and yet there’s still a spot underneath the tongue area that rubs/ digs into the top of my foot no matter how loose I wear them. That alone makes them too painful to wear. Would not buy again.
Not durable,9.5,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,Toe lip split from the sole. Very little use and the soles are very thin with tread loss.
"Great looking, but flawed",NA,NA,2.0,"The shoe is very attractive and on trend.
Unfortunately, there is little traction for snow or ice.
There is no arch support; requires installation of your own footbeds."
Felt cheap,10,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,These shoes I expected to be sturdy and comfortable for the price but they felt thin and like I had to be careful in them or they would get ruined. For the price you can get better shoes.
Poor quality,11,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,"Loved the shoe, very cute but not quality for the price. Sizing runs 1 whole size too small. Wore these shoes a few times and the toe box detached from the sole. Returned them no problem but very disappointed overall."
Poor quality,8,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,"These are adorable but I am so bummed. The quality is poor, not typical for sorels. They are not super comfy-harder inside and don’t keep my feet warm on my 2 mile walk"
NOT COMFORTABLE,NA,NA,2.0,I thought when I purchased these shoes they would be comfortable because of the thick sole. I was wrong. If you have to stand or walk for a long time they are VERY uncomfortable.
They run small,9.5,"Black, Grill",2.0,"I wear size 9, ordered 9 1/2 to accommodate a winter sock. Boot still to small, my toes were pushing against end with a thin Summer sock. Returning and ordering a 10. Hoping it will fit just right."
Great Boots!,8.5,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,I really love these boots. Very comfy and true to size. They actually look small on my feet. There was nothing I disliked about these boots.
"Very comfortable, sole seams are coming apart after just two months, quality is lacking",8,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,"Very comfortable, but sole seams are coming apart after just two months, quality is lacking :/"
Cute but no support,NA,NA,2.0,These are very cute. But there is no support at all. I love Sorel but had to return these.
Not warm enough,11,"Black, Grill",2.0,Expected to be much warmer for the price.
Not great,7,"Dove, Sea Sprite",2.0,"These were meant to be warm for walking on snowy days. Not warm, not that comfortable and be careful on ice! The sole doesn't have much traction and I have fallen on ice several times."
Very slippery,9,"Taffy, Black",2.0,Very slippery in snow and they do run small
NA,10,"Taffy, Black",2.0,"Ces bottes ne sont pas des bottes d’hiver pour grand froid. Elle sont adaptés pour le début et fin d’hiver seulement. La taille est juste au tableau des grandeurs. La problématique vient du service à la clientèle. Les bottes sont tombées en rabais deux jours suivant mon achat. J’ai Demandé un ajustement de prix. Lors de ma demande, les bottes étaient toujours disponibles dans ma grandeur. Hors, le délai de réponse de Sorel a fait en sorte que les bottes n’étaient plus disponibles. Ils ont alors refusé de me faire un ajustement de prix sous prétexte qu’elles n’étaient plus disponibles au moment de leur réponse. J’aurais donc dû racheté les bottes en spécial, attendre leur arrivées les retourner avec ma première facture plein prix à Sorel ensuite à leur frais pour obtenir le rabais. Un beau gaspillage de temps et de resources. En 2021, je pensais que Sorel serait un peu plus consciencieux de l’environnement."
NA,NA,NA,2.0,"No insulation for warmth in these boots.
The round toe isn’t ideal as it squishes toes. Definitely size up to avoid that.
I returned as I did not love these boots, although they were a nice look"
NA,NA,NA,2.0,"I have a proper pair of warm mukluk style Sorels and love them, but these are not remotely warm. Reading that they were winter boots, I expected some insulation. There is none. These are, effectively, just shells. Worse, the leather tongue folds uncomfortable when I lace them and the constantly hurt the top of my feet. I might see about buying some felt liners for them if I can find something, but I'm super disappointed in them for the price. My ugly Walmart brand ones were $30, lasted 3 years and were much warmer. Boo."
NA,10,"Black, Grill",2.0,"i order this boot late Dec 2021 ... they are not my everyday boot ....
yet for $150 ... i dont think they should be coming part already ...
i have tried to send an email ... ( to the address they provided 0 but nothing )

would not recommend."
NA,8.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",2.0,"The boots fit well, they look nice, but the quality is poor, the loop at the back of the boot is tearing already after 4 days of use, these were a Christmas gift."
NA,8.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",2.0,"The tongue is far too narrow, does not sit flush and rubs the top of your foot"
NA,9,"Camel Brown, Black",2.0,Are these warm?
Disappointed,NA,NA,1.0,"I love Sorel. My Caribous are at least 15 years old and are still in great shape. This bootie is comfortable and light weight. I received these just after the new year 2022. Wore them through mid March 2022, and the right sole started to come off by the outside toe. Started wearing them mid December 2023 until a week ago, when the back of the sole came off. A coworker off mine has the same exact style, and her right sole is coming off on the outside toe area. The right boot pull tab lasted about a month. Total wear time of less than 6 months. Don't waste your money. Very disappointed in the craftsmanship."
BEWARE! They run small/prices vary on sizes!,NA,NA,1.0,"My shoe size is a true 7.5
That is the size I ordered for these boots.
Sadly, the boots run small. I needed to exchange/order half-size larger as my toes were touching the front of the boot (and I also wanted to be able to insert my custom orthotics inside of them).
In the process of trying to return/exchange these boots for the very same color and style, just a half-size larger (they DO run small), I learned that there is a price increase of $52.00! Whaaaat? Why?
I refuse to be ""played with"" like that and will simply be returning them."
Only had for less than 4 months and already falling apart,9,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,"Bought these shoes in September, I figured I would spend a lot of money on some good boots that will last me a while for snow/rain dog walks. They are very wide, no arch support and the laces will not stay tied. I added inserts for arch support and that helped slightly. Now its January, I have had them less than 4 months and the sole is separating from the shoe letting water in. They are useless to me at this point, as they are no longer waterproof. I wore them a lot, but not daily... how can $130 boots fall apart so quickly? It is too late to return them, so I am stuck with useless boots. DO NOT BUY."
Not the normal Sorel quality,8,"Black, Grill",1.0,"I’ve owned a lot of Sorel boots and I’ve loved all of them. I ordered these online in my normal size 8 with full confidence they would be like all my other Sorel boots: comfortable, waterproof and long lasting. These boots shipped fast, but as soon as I put them on my feet I instantly knew I was returning them. THEY RUN SUPER SMALL. Like incredibly small. I read that in the reviews and thought people were being dramatic and ordered their wrong size but they weren’t kidding. They are also incredibly uncomfortable. The insert feels like hard rubber, there is no support at all. I didn’t even want to wear them for 5 seconds, let alone all day. I’m bummed because these look super cute and I wanted to love them but they just didn’t work"
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,9,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,"I purchased 3 separate pairs of these boots. First 2 from Nordstrom, last pair from Amazon. All three of them fell apart and had cracks at the seams of the soles within just a couple of months of use/wear.
I was extremely disappointed with the quality of these given the price tag and the brand's reputation.
So far my $40 boots from Target that I purchased after my experience with these are holding up with no issues, and it's been more than several months now.
Seriously, do not waste your money on these!!!"
Not worth the money.,8,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,"Started falling apart after only a few weeks. The rubber soles are coming unattached, both boots. Water, snow, dirt, etc, get inside. Not warm at all.
Unfortunately I purchased them before winter started when my size became available. So return period was over when they started falling apart. Sorel's warranty is terrible. They will either fix (what a joke, for the price) or give a store credit.... BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY TO SHIP THEM IN."
Runs small,11,"Black, Grill",1.0,Thought and wanted to love this shoe but they run small and are not quality made as I thought. Was thinking maybe since they are on here maybe this is their aftermarket or ones that they cannot sell in their store/website???!!
Do not buy these!!!,7.5,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,I am so disappointed in these. They are not real Sorel boots. I wore them just walking around in the city for about a month and the seal on the toe started peeling off. So sad because they’re adorable. Save yourself the trouble and buy them from a different source.
Defective shoes! Buyer beware!,10,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,"I loved these shoes!…until they started falling apart. The front of the boots where two materials come together are slowly coming apart. I wear these boots around 3 days per week and they are comfortable. I have had them for about two months, which is not normal for high quality shoes to start falling apart with normal wear. I am so sad, unless the issue is fixed I will not be purchasing or recommending Sorel in the future."
Coming apart,8,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,I bought these last month and have barely worn them and they soles are coming off of the shoe and they no longer keep my feet dry or warm. How do I get these replaced?
Sole does not hold up,11,"Dove, Sea Sprite",1.0,"After 4 months of use the sole started separating from the shoe. I used them maybe once every week, if that. Quality is poor for something that costs $130 and they expect you to pay to ship it to them for their warranty. I’ve paid less for boots that have lasted longer."
Fell Apart Quickly,6,"Taffy, Black",1.0,"At first, loved them. But two months in the bottoms started to separate from shoe. Of course the return window has passed. Very disappointed as they cost a bit of money, you expect them to last (longer)… period."
Wrong size received,8,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,"I was very excited about getting these boots! I ordered a 8 , which is my normal size. I received the box which was labeled size 8 and when I tried the boot on, they were huge, so I looked at the tag and it was an 8.5. The color and style of the boot was great but unfortunately the wrong size was sent and they were going to be way too big. Will try to reorder when they come back in stock or maybe from actual Sorel store."
Soles become unglued not waterproof.,9,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,This is a poorly made boot. All the soles have decode unglued. It is not waterproof.
This product fell apart in less then 6 weeks,7.5,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,I bought the boots for my daughter for Christmas. The soles separated from the upper boot. They are completely useless to her. The boots have good reviews listed on Amazon but I don’t know how that’s possible. I would rate the boots “0” if option was available.
Wanted to love these... But didn't,7.5,"White, Cyber Yellow",1.0,"These are beautiful shoes. That's their only redeeming quality. I normally wear a 7.5 and that size was too small; my toes bumped the end very uncomfortably. The 8 was way too large in the toe box, almost like clown shoes. The worst part, by far, was the tongue. It felt huge and was very uncomfortable. In both sizes, the top of my foot was unacceptably uncomfortable."
Sole is separating after just basic wear and only 1 light snow wear.,11,"Dove, Sea Sprite",1.0,I love Sorel boots and have had great luck in the past. This pair has been a huge disappointment. After less than 2 months of wear and only 1 snow fall the sole is separating from the bottom of the boot. These are way to expensive to be having this happen so soon.
Hole in boot,9,"Taffy, Black",1.0,After having the boots less than 2 months they are falling apart. The rubber by the right toe was never glued correctly and now there is a hole forming underneath. These were very expensive boots and disappointingly put together.
Didn’t last 1 winter,8,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,"I ordered these in October 2022, I noticed January of 2023 that the sole started to separate causing my socks to get wet. I was hopeful for them to last at least 2 winters given they are a little pricey. UPDATE: I gave them another try, my new pair is not warm or waterproof. This company sucks."
Had for a month and they fell apart,10,"Dove, Sea Sprite",1.0,Had these for a month and they are already felling apart. So disappointed. How are they supposed to be waterproof and for rain and snow when the soles are gapping open. Wish I could return\exchange these but I am a day to late.
Fell apart after 2 months.,10,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,I bought these and loved them at first! Then they started to fray and come apart. The rubber soles have ripped off almost completely 2 months later. I’m so sad I can’t use them or return them. For the price and brand this is really disappointing.
Do not buy,9,"Omega Taupe, Black",1.0,"very nice shoes except for the fact that they fell apart after costing a fortune. The rubber soles are coming unattached, both boots. Water get inside. Don’t waste your money. Very disappointed in the craftsmanship."
Sole is already pulling off,10,"Taffy, Black",1.0,I have only had these boots less than 2 months going to and from school drop off a few days a week. They are already falling apart. Very nice boot other than them falling apart after it costing a small fortune…
very difficult to return this product w/o paying over $30 for return shipping.,11,"Taffy, Black",1.0,"Return policy is a huge ripoff, too expensive just to test whether you like the product and fit. Boot fits very tight at mid-tongue spot when laced up, would cause blister with walking. Seller had thus far not sent a prepaid return label or option to eastonfam2017@comcast.net"
"Terrible seller, find another",NA,NA,1.0,BEWARE! I am a prime member and had to pay $25.00 to return the shoes. THEN they charge $33.00 to restock!! Why are you allowed to sell on Amazon!? DO NOT BUY FROM FOCUSED3. Love the boots!
Received someone nasty foot odor as well,9,"Omega Taupe, Black",1.0,Didn’t like anything about worst ever
Cute shoe,7.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",1.0,"This shoe is so cute , however , I could not find a comfortable for despite trying multiple sizes. Something with the tongue of shoe feels weird. Had to return"
Falling apart!!,8.5,"Taffy, Black",1.0,These are my 6th pair of Sorel boots. They are adorable and I love them but they are falling apart after less than a month of wearing.
"Shoes run small, return postage not covered",7.5,"Taffy, Black",1.0,The shoes seemed well made but run small. The the seller charged $190 for $160 shoes. Then did not cover return postage. It cost $30 to return these shoes so keep that in mind if ordering from this selller
Only wore for two months and already falling apart! DON’T BUY!!,11,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,Only wore for two months and already falling apart! DON’T BUY!!
Fell apart in less then a year 😩.,9,"Black, Grill",1.0,"I finally caved on the price and bought a pair of these boots. I can honestly say I loves everything about them, until they came unglued in less then 1 year of wear. I’m so bummed at my stupidity for thinking this brand should last longer."
Poor Quality,8,"Black, Grill",1.0,I have owned these boots for a couple of months and the sole is already falling apart. I would expect better quality from a shoe that cost this much.
Seam splitting after 3 weeks,10,"Omega Taupe, Black",1.0,"Love these boots, but seam on side of toe not secure. Poor quality for only 3 weeks of use."
Cute but not very durable,7,"Black, Grill",1.0,Boots were purchased in January 2023 and have only been worn casually. Rubber shell sole is already separating at the toe.

Cheaply made!,8,"Taffy, Black",1.0,Received in mail and boxed for Christmas gift. Wore once and the sole is separating.
Size up one size,9,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,This boots run small. They are uncomfortable to wear.
So painful I couldn’t walk three steps,7.5,"Black, Sea Salt",1.0,"Got this pair in my usual Sorel size and was stunned by the awful quality. There’s a thick piece of lining connecting the tongue to the shoe and it feels like four sharp rocks jabbing into your foot - I couldn’t even walk across the room in these. So painful! If it were only one shoe I would assume it was a defect - but it’s in both of them. Worst shoes I’ve ever had, by far!"
Falling apart,8.5,"Black, Grill",1.0,Falling apart ALREADY! Less than 2 month old! Buyer beware. Will try to contact company for replacement. Out $130 if company will not replace.
Soul coming off 28 days after return window closed,9,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,Like the boots very much but now the soul is coming off the boots.

DOES NOT KEEP FEET WARM!!!,6,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,"I bought these for cold, snowy, Midwest winters, and they are not insulated! Waterproof yes, thermal no. My feet FREEZE in this boots, disappointed since I spent so much money on something that now only looks cute but isn’t practically functional."
"So cute, but Broke immediately",5,"Omega Taupe, Black",1.0,"First of all, I was excited to receive this shoe as a gift to myself.I got rid of my other Sorel boots bc they were 17 years old and completely out of date, clunky and heavy. Basing my purchase upon the longevity and warmth of Sorel I bought these thinking they would be great as a mom of 6 for around town stuff in the winter snow and rain. Upon arrival...they were super cute, I purchased an 8.5, and they felt a bit big, but with thick socks felt great. After one, that's right...ONE day of easy wearing, the shoelace eyelet broke.
I'd love to get another pair but I am afraid the same thing will happen and it will be beyond my 30 day window AND $130 IS A LOT of money for a boot that may not even last one day, let alone 17 winters like my other Sorels....I am sad, and now left wearing old lady styled costco booties that seem to never die."

So uncomfortable,7.5,"Camel Brown, Black",1.0,"I couldn’t even wear these for more than a couple minutes. The tongue digs into the top of the foot and just makes them miserable to wear. They are so cute and I’m sad to send them back. For the price, I want comfort."
very strange fit,9,"Black, Grill",1.0,"The toe was tight and the heel loose, this is after trying two pairs. Very cute but really odd fit."

NA,8.5,"Omega Taupe, Black",1.0,"Returned these boots because they were too small. Wouldn't have kept them anyway because they are not winter boots, at least not for Northern Ontario. Very little lining and almost no treads on them, they're more a stylish rain boot."
